The sources are arranged in the following directory:
lab6/shared/
	html.h html.c (HTML parsers, where getNextUrl() hides)
	hash.h hash.c (hash functions)

lab6/crawler/src/
	crawler.h crawler.c (the main entry, the crawler main logic is here)
	crawler_test.h (test script that tests crawler for arguments & equality of 
	                original and re-created index)
	Makefile (make file for compiling the indexer)
	temp (temporary file to store data)
	
	==> To build the crawler
	goto /lab6/crawler/src and type "make"

	==> To run the crawler
	ex) "./crawler http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/ ../../data 3"

	==> To test the crawler
	goto /lab6/crawler/src and type "./crawler_test.sh"
	     This script will: 
	     1 Test the argument checking of crawler.
	     2 Test for an invalid specified directory.
	     3 Test the termination of crawler.
