The sources are arranged in the following directory:
lab6/shared/
	html.h html.c (HTML parsers, where getNextUrl() hides)
	hash.h hash.c (hash functions)
	
/lab6/data/   (where the data output from the crawler is stores)
	
lab6/indexer/util (where the general purpose utilities file is located)
	input.c input.h (file access and input processing utilities are located)

lab6/indexer/src/
	indexer.c (the main entry, the indexer main logic is here)
	dictionary.h dictionary.c (contains index data structure library & related functions)
	indexer_test.h (test script that tests crawler for arguments & equality of 
	                original and re-created index)
	Makefile (make file for compiling the indexer)
	
	==> To build the indexer
	goto /lab6/indexer/src and type "make"

	==> To run the indexer
	ex) "./indexer ../../data index.dat"

	==> To test the indexer
	goto /lab6/indexer/src and type "./indexer_test.sh"
	     This script will: 
	     1 Test the argument checking of indexer.
	     2 Test for an invalid specified directory.
	     3 Test the termination of indexer.
	     4 Compare the output of the index.dat file and the re-created indexR.dat file
