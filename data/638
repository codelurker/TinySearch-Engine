<META NAME="abstract" CONTENT=" In many different areas of computing, problems can arise which are
too large to fit in main memory.  For these problems, the I/O cost of
moving data between main memory and secondary storage (for example,
disks) becomes a significant bottleneck affecting the performance of
the program.
 Since most algorithms do not take into account the size of main
memory, new algorithms have been developed to optimize the number of
I/O's performed.  This paper details the implementation of one such
algorithm, for external-memory depth-first search.
 Depth-first search is a basic tool for solving many problems in graph
theory, and since graph theory is applicable for many large
computational problems, it is important to make sure that such a basic
tool is designed to avoid the bottleneck of main memory to secondary
storage I/O's.
 The algorithm whose implementation is described in this paper is
sketched out in an extended abstract by Chiang et al.  We attempt to
improve the given algorithm by minimizing I/O's performed, and to
extend the algorithm by finding disjoint trees, and by classifying all
the edges in the problem.">
