The purpose of this course is to teach you about operating systems:
the stuff that lies between
<ul>
<li> the basic hardware
<li> and what you "see" when you use or program a machine.
</ul>
This "stuff" includes:
<ul>
<li> the abstractions that comprise what you "see"
<li> the goals that drive the design of these abstractions
<li> what these abstractions look like from the <strong>outside</strong>
<li> what these abstractions look like from the <strong>inside</strong>
<li> ...and how this all works (or fails to work) as hardware and usage
paradigms evolve
</ul>
<p>
I hope you learn a lot, and have fun too.
Systems is a great area: you can prove theorems,
you can get your hands dirty with hardware...and do everything
in between.
