Rainbow Icosahedra

<h1>Rainbow Icosahedra</h1>
This puzzle was inspired by playing with a 
<a href="http://www.magz.com">Magz</a> magnetic ball-and-stick toy:
how to color (in the usual mathematical sense) the
edges of an icosahedron with 6 colors?
<p>
Why use six colors, when 
it's easy with five? 
[<a href="http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath095.htm">MathPages.com</a>]
Notice that <i>C</i>(6,3), the number of combinations of 6 colors
taken 3 at a time, is 20--the same as the number of faces.
Now the problem gets interesting!
You may enjoy trying it before looking at my solutions.
<p>
<b>Problem.</b>
In how many ways, distinct under symmetries of the icosahedron
and renaming of the colors, can the edges of
a regular icosahedron be colored with 6 colors so that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all 5 edges meeting at any vertex have different colors, and 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each combination of 3 distinct colors occurs on the boundary
of some face?
<p>
<b>Observation 1.</b>
In any such coloring each
color must appear on exactly 5 of the 30 edges
of the icosahedron.
For consider one color, say red.
<i>C</i>(5,2)=10 is the number of pairs of non-red colors, and hence
the number of distinctly colored triangles with one red edge.
Since each red edge borders two triangles, there must be 5 red edges.
<p>
<b>Observation 2.</b>
Think of the 5 edges of one color as a "tile",
albeit a completely disconnected one.  Then we can address the problem 
without attention to colors:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;find all the distinct shapes of tiles; 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;find all the ways of tiling the icosahedron with these shapes; and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discard tilings in which 2 faces touch the same 3 tiles.
<p>
A Haskell program to carry out this plan
revealed just 18 tile shapes and 12 tilings. 
<p>
One tiling has 3-fold rotational symmetry: <a href="3fold.ps">PostScript</a>
or <a href="3fold.pdf">PDF</a> or <a href="3fold.html">HTML</a> (lower quality).
<p>
Four tilings have 5-fold rotational symmetry:
<a href="5fold.ps">PostScript</a>
or <a href="5fold.pdf">PDF</a>.
<p>
The other seven tilings lack symmetry: <a href="1fold.ps">PostScript</a>
or <a href="1fold.pdf">PDF</a>.
<p>
<h4>Some properties of the tilings</h4>
No tiling has a symmetry group of even order,
despite the abundance of even-order subgroups in the
icosahedral group.
In particular, no tiling is invariant under
reflection, 180-degree rotation, or central inversion coupled
with renaming of colors.
<p>
Every tiling uses tiles of more than one shape.
However the 3-fold symmetric tiling can be
seen as 3 congruent bicolor supertiles.
<p>
Each of the 18 tile shapes occurs in some tiling.
<h4> Related 5-colorings</h4>
Branko Grunbaum suggested looking for 5-colorings in
which each combination of colors occurs on exactly
two faces with the colors in opposite
sequence on the two faces.
All 13 such colorings have even-order symmetry groups.
One example
has the full symmetry of the icosahedron:
<a href="5color.ps">PostScript</a>,&nbsp;
<a href="5color.pdf">PDF</a>.
<h4> Dual problems</h4>
By duality, one can color the edges of a dodecahedron
with 6 colors so that every combination of 3 colors
meets at exactly one vertex, or with 5 colors so that
every sequence of three colors occurs clockwise about exactly
one vertex.
<p>
John Conway found there are three
<a href="http://www.neverendingbooks.org/index.php/quintominal-dodecahedra.html">5-colorings of the edges of a
dodecahedron</a> such that each of the twelve
5-color necklaces, distinct under rotation and reversal,
occurs around some face.
These colorings are dual to 5-colorings of the
edges of an icosahedron in which every sequence
of 5 colors occurs
clockwise or else counterclockwise about exactly one vertex.
