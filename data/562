<b> A Brief History of Ancient Egyptian Tombs </b> <BR>
<b> by Samir Farid and Hany Farid </b>
</center>
<BR><BR>

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
<b> Introduction </b>
<p>

The history of Pharonic Egypt spans nearly 3 millennia, starting
around 3100 BC. Major accomplishments were achieved during 3 periods:
the Old, Middle and New Kingdoms which lasted roughly 500 years
(2700-2200 BC), 200 years (2000-1800 BC), and 500 years (1600-1100
BC). These periods were interrupted by intermediate periods where loss
of central authority or foreign invasion led to decline.

<p>

The ancient Egyptian civilization changed dramatically over these 1600
years, and many of these changes are reflected in how the tombs of the
Kings and Queens, Nobleman, and Workers were built and decorated.

<b> The Royal Tombs </b>
<p>

The mastaba was the earliest and simplest tomb structure. It consisted
of a single elevated platform and was built of mud-brick.  These
structures were not particularly elaborate and were not decorated.

<p>

In the 3rd dynasty (Old Kingdom) Imhotep built the step pyramid
(Fig. 1) for Zoser. This structure was the first all stone monument
and was, of course, the inspiration for the true pyramids that
followed, culminating into the pyramids of Giza, and in particular the
great pyramid of Khufu.

The pyramids were the major achievements of the 4th dynasty -
approximately 2500 BC (Old Kingdom) - and were built for Khufu, Khafre
and Menkaure (Fig. 2). These structures are truly awesome.  The
pyramid of Khufu, for example:
<ul>
        <li> contains over 2,300,000 stones
        <li> the base is 13 square acres, 568,500 sq. ft, or 7 city blocks
        <li> the side of each base is 754 feet, or more than 2 football fields
        <li> the pyramid weights 6.5 million tons
        <li> each stone weighs approximately 2.5 tons
        <li> and is 481 feet tall
</ul>
Because the king was revered as God, his tomb (the pyramid) was
constructed to last forever, thus ensuring the continuing prosperity
of the king in his afterlife.  Like the early mastabas, the 4th
dynasty pyramids had no decorations.

The 5th dynasty (Old Kingdom) which saw the construction of more
modest pyramids contained the first decorations. These decorations
(Fig. 3 and <a href="121.1.small.jpg">4</a>) took the form of
hieroglyphic writings - known as the Pyramid Texts - which provide
guidelines and instructions on how to ensure safe voyage through the
nether world and the eternal life thereafter.

The construction of the pyramids disappeared during the first
intermediate period and attempts for revival during the Middle Kingdom
were far from  successful.

<p>

A very different approach was taken in the New Kingdom. Very
elaborate, deep underground tombs were the norm. Interestingly these
were constructed in an area dominated by a huge natural pyramid- shaped
formation. Part of the reason for this change was to conceal the tombs
from robbers. The New Kingdom saw perhaps the most glorious
tombs. These tombs were decorated with scenes of the journey that the
king (or queen) would take as they moved from this life to the
afterlife and showing the King in the presence of major deities and
making offerings to them. The scenes were highly colored and drawn
from vignettes from the book of the dead and related subjects
(Fig. 5).

<p>

Each tomb, however, could look dramatically different as
experimentation with different styles were undertaken.  Shown in
Fig. 5 are samples from the tombs of Tutmosis III, Horemhab, and Queen
Nefertari.

<b> The Tombs of the Noblemen </b>

<p>

The noblemen (the ranking government officials) and high priests had
decidedly more modest tombs. In the Old Kingdom, while pyramids were
being built for kings, the noblemen were buried in mastabas. These
mastabas were decorated with non-religious scenes depicting the daily
life and official duties of the nobleman (Shown in Fig. 16, <a
href="091.1.small.jpg">17</a>, <a href="093.1.small.jpg">18</a>, <a
href="099.1.small.jpg">19</a>, <a href="100.1.small.jpg">20</a>, <a
href="102.1.small.jpg">21</a>, <a href="112.1.small.jpg">22</a>, and
<a href="104.1.small.jpg">23</a> are scenes from tombs of Noblemen).
Association of afterlife in the company of Gods was reserved for the
kings. The noblemen's tombs served more as a place where offering for
the deceased can be made.

<p>

Starting with the Middle Kingdom and progressively through the New
Kingdom democratization of religion began to be the norm. Tombs of the
noblemen continued to depict their daily activities as well as scenes
with strong religious overtones. Common people were expected to be in
the company of Gods, who will see to it that they will be favorably
judged and will make it safely through the arduous voyage in the
nether word to emerge in paradise, where they will enjoy eternal
life. 
<p>

The tombs of the New Kingdom's noblemen are beautifully decorated with
such scenes. Unlike the royal tombs, which are confined to specific
norms, the private tombs' decorations often break with these norms and
are therefore artistically more pleasing.  For example, shown in
Fig. 24, <a href="063.2.small.jpg">25</a>, and <a
href="064.2.small.jpg">26</a> are scenes from Sennefer's tomb.

<b> The Tombs of the Workers </b>
<p>
A special type of tombs known from the New Kingdom are those of the
workers who built the royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings. Although
these were people of limited resources, they were well-equipped and
skilled in tomb building. Because of their valued contribution to the
royal families and noble elite to tomb construction, they were
permitted to build their own "house of eternity".  The tombs of the
workers (in the <a href="065.2.small.jpg">Deir el-Medina</a>) were
notably more modest than those of the kings or noblemen - typically
1/5 the size of the noblemen's tombs which themselves were 1/5 the
size of the kings.

<p>

These tombs, not constrained by long traditions, tend to be much
more charming, and show an incredible diversity in their
decorations. The tombs of Pashedu, Anher-Khau, and Sennedjem, all
dating to the 19th Dynasty can be seen to be dramatically different
(Fig. 27). Note also how the democratization of religion made its way
down to the workers.

<b> Unfolding Sennedjem's Tomb </b>
<p>
Sennedjem's burial chamber, measuring 5.12 m by 2.61 m with its
vaulted ceiling of 2.40 m, is completely decorated; a total surface
area of about 40 sq. m. Two views showing approximately one third of
the chamber convey the closeness of the space, Fig. 28. Because of
this space confinement and the strong curvature of the ceiling,
however, it is difficult to combine in one photograph a large enough
portion of the walls and of the ceiling to give an encompassing view
of the panels and to display the sequence of the scenes.

<BR><BR>
<p>
It might be possible to piece together photographs from small areas of
the ceiling and walls. Virtually any region from the curved ceiling,
however, remains substantially distorted and this makes it impossible
to combine, in any reasonable manner, neighboring photographs. For
example, the pair of neighboring ceiling panels shown in Fig. 29 (top)
contains the same vertical strip of hieroglyphic inscription. However,
due to the distortions they are bowed in opposite directions, making
it impossible to combine these images.

<p>

To contend with these problems we have developed a computational
technique for digitally estimating and removing distortions, thus
allowing us to create a single distortion-free large-scale mosaic
(Fig. 29 and <a href="s3.jpg">30</a>).
