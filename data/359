<h2>When?</h2>

The third edition of <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i> has a projected
publication date of September 2009.

<h2>Who?</h2>

The authors are the same as in the second edition: Tom Cormen, Charles
Leiserson, Ron Rivest, and Cliff Stein.

<p>

The third edition will be published only by The MIT Press.

<h2>How big?</h2>

The third edition weighs in at 1312 pages, including all front and
back matter.

<h2>What changed?</h2>

A partial list of changes for the third edition:

<ul>
  <li> Two new chapters: van Emde Boas Trees and Multithreaded Algorithms.
  <li> Material on matrix basics becomes a new appendix chapter.
  <li> New chapter on divide-and-conquer includes material on solving
       recurrences and applications of divide-and-conquer (including
       Strassen's algorithm).
  <li> Removed two rarely taught chapters: Binomial Heaps and Sorting
       Networks.  The 0-1 principle persists in the third edition as
       part of a new problem.  The treatment of Fibonacci heaps no longer
       relies on binomial heaps as a precursor.
  <li> Revised treatment of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms.
       Dynamic programming starts with a more interesting problem, rod
       cutting, than the assembly-line scheduling problem from the second
       edition.  We emphasize memoization more than in the second edition.
       The activity-selection problem in the chapter on greedy algorithms
       gets to the greedy algorithm more directly than in the second
       edition.
  <li> The node actually deleted from a binary search tree or red-black
       tree is always the node passed to the deletion procedure.  (In the
       first two editions, sometimes a different node is deleted.)  With
       the new way to delete nodes, pointers to nodes in a binary search
       tree or red-black tree won't mistakenly reference deleted nodes.
  <li> The material on flow networks bases flows entirely on edges.
  <li> Modified treatment of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt string-matching
       algorithm.
  <li> Many errors corrected.
  <li> Changes to pseudocode syntax: "=" indicates assignment, "=="
       tests for equality, eliminated keywords <b>do</b> and
       <b>then</b>, "<b>//</b>" is comment-to-end-of-line symbol, and
       dot-notation indicates object attributes.
  <li> Added 100 new exercises and 28 new problems.
  <li> Many sentences, paragraphs, and sections rewritten to make the
       writing clearer and more active.
</ul>

<h2>How much?</h2>

The list price from MIT Press is $87.00 for cloth cover and $64.00 for
paperback (not for sale in the U.S. or Canada).

<h2>Instructor's manual?</h2>

We expect to produce one.

<h2>Web site?</h2>

We will have a web site for the third edition.  Among other content,
it will provide solutions to some (but certainly not all) of the
exercises and problems.

<h2>Geeky professor jokes?</h2>

Of course.  And we made sure to include more women among the
professors.  (Joyce Kilmer almost tripped us up.)

<h2>Official website?</h2>

For now, use <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=11866">this one</a>.
