<h1>Dartmouth Technical Report Notification Service</h1>

<h3>Want to keep up to date?</h3>

If you find some of our research interesting, and want to hear about
new technical reports without having to check our web page
periodically, you have two choices: 
<ul>
  <li> <b>subscribe to our RSS feed</b>:
       <a href=/reports/feed.xml><img src=/reports/rss.gif><a>
  <li> <b>subscribe to our electronic mailing list</b>:
       <a href="http://listserv.dartmouth.org/scripts/wa.exe?SUBED1=CS-TR">LISTSERV</a>.
</ul>

<p>
We issue about 30-40 technical reports each year--- less than one per
week on average, so you won't get much traffic.  But you'll be sure to
hear about new technical reports right away!
