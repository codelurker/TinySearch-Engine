<h1>About</h1>

<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>The Adv. Computer Graphics course will introduce students to current research topics in Computer Graphics. 
We will focus in particular on real-time rendering and computational photography.</p>
<p>
Students will be required to read papers, present some of the topics and develop a project during 
the course. While I will have a list of interesting projects to choose from,
students are welcome to propose their own projects (which I will review before accepting).</p>

<h2>Coursework</h2>

<h3>Paper Presentation</h3>

<p>
You will be required to present various papers during the course.
It is suggested that you choose presentation in an area of interest to you and
as related to your final project as possible.
</p>

<p>Presentations do not need to be long, but should clearly address paper
motivation, background, contribution and results.</p>

<h3>Class Participation</h3>

<p>You are required to read all papers presented in the course, even if you are
not assigned to present them. Discussion will follow each paper presentation and
participation during the discussion will be evaluated.</p>

<h3>Project</h3>

<p>One of the main goals of the course is to get hands on experience implementing
come graphics algorithm into a working system. While I will provide interesting ideas
for projects, you are free to choose the topic that mostly interest you, 
which I will have to approve.</p>

<p>In general, it is possible to work on a project in two ways.<br/>
For a successfull <em>implementation project</em>, students are required to implement some of the main
ideas from one or two papers. A careful implementation and cool demo is expected at the end of the term.<br/>
For a successfull <em>exploration project</em>, students are required to explore a novel idea related to
one of the topics covered in class. The idea might not work at the end, but a suitable implementation should be
presented nonetheless.<br/>
In general expect implementation projects require more coding than exploration projects.
</p>

<p>Projects can be either done alone or in groups of no more than two students. 
When grading, it is expected that group projects have roughly twice the 
contribution than individual ones.</p>

<p>Expecially for exploration projects, but even for implementation ones, 
you should expect to work closely with the instructor during the quarter.
This will make the project more successfull, the research more interesting, 
and the class more fun for all.<br/>
We will have brief in-class weekly progress reports as well as longer biweekly sessions
to discuss the project. Ultimately it is your responsability though to seek help
if you feel stuck during the work.
</p>

<h3>Grading, Late Assignments and Extra credit</h3>

<p>The final grade from this class will be decided by your class participation (15%),
your presentations (%25%) and your project (60%).<br/>
Please note that I will evaluate your project twice, 
roughly in the middle (25%) and at the end of class (35%).
This is to encourage you to make progress on your project early on and give 
you more feedback on how you are doing during the class.
</p>

<p>
I will not accept late submissions for any of the assignments. Exception to this rule might 
be made for special cases only if the professor is informed way before the deadline and at his 
sole discretion.</p>

<p>Note that I am including here rough percentage of the final grade as indication only.
These are subject to change and it is possible that I will weight things differently 
at the end of the class.</p>

<h3>Working Together and Academic Integrity</h3>

<p>You are encouraged to talk to other students about the topics discussed in class
as well as your project.  The goal is to get a deeper understanding of
the material and further develop ideas related to your project.</p>

<p>Once it gets to preparing your presentation and your project,
you should only work by yourself or within your group.</p>

<p>You are welcome to use any source of information that can deepen your understandiung 
of the material. For some project, it may be necessary to include code/components available from elsewhere.
In this case, please consult me before doing so.</p>
