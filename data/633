<META NAME="abstract" CONTENT="	Self-reconfigurable robots are designed so that they can
change their external shape without human intervention.  One general
way to achieve such functionality is to build a robot composed of
multiple, identical unit modules.  If the modules are designed so that
they can be assembled into rigid structures, and so that individual
units within such structures can be relocated within and about the
structure, then self-reconfiguration is possible. 
	We propose the Crystalline Atomic unit modular
self-reconfigurable robot, where each unit is called an Atom.  In two
dimensions, an Atom is square.  Connectors at the faces of each Atom
support structure formation (such structures are called Crystals).
Centrally placed prismatic degrees of freedom give Atoms the ability
to contract their outer side-length by a constant factor.  By
contracting and expanding groups of Atoms in a coordinated way, Atoms
can relocate within and about Crystals.  Thus Atoms are shown to
satisfy the two properties necessary to function as modules of a
self-reconfigurable robot. 
	A powerful software simulator for Crystalline Atomic robots in
two and three dimensions, called xtalsim, is presented.  Xtalsim
includes a high-level language interface for specifying
reconfigurations, an engine which expands implicit reconfiguration
plans into explicit Crystal state sequences, and an interactive
animator which displays the results in a virtual environment. 
	An automated planning algorithm for generating
reconfigurations, called the Melt-Grow planner, is described.  The
Melt-Grow planner is fast (O(n2) for Crystals of n Atoms) and complete
for a fully general subset of Crystals.  The Melt-Grow planner is
implemented and interfaced to xtalsim, and an automatically planned
reconfiguration is simulated. 
	Finally, the mechanics, electronics, and software for an Atom
implementation are developed.  Two Atoms are constructed and
experiments are performed which indicate that, with some hardware
improvements, an interesting self-reconfiguration could be
demonstrated by a group of Atoms. ">

	Self-reconfigurable robots are designed so that they can
change their external shape without human intervention.  One general
way to achieve such functionality is to build a robot composed of
multiple, identical unit modules.  If the modules are designed so that
they can be assembled into rigid structures, and so that individual
units within such structures can be relocated within and about the
structure, then self-reconfiguration is possible. 
</P><P>
	We propose the Crystalline Atomic unit modular
self-reconfigurable robot, where each unit is called an Atom.  In two
dimensions, an Atom is square.  Connectors at the faces of each Atom
support structure formation (such structures are called Crystals).
Centrally placed prismatic degrees of freedom give Atoms the ability
to contract their outer side-length by a constant factor.  By
contracting and expanding groups of Atoms in a coordinated way, Atoms
can relocate within and about Crystals.  Thus Atoms are shown to
satisfy the two properties necessary to function as modules of a
self-reconfigurable robot.

	A powerful software simulator for Crystalline Atomic robots in
two and three dimensions, called xtalsim, is presented.  Xtalsim
includes a high-level language interface for specifying
