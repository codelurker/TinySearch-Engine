with dynamically updated data sources.  It allows simulations and 
other agents to join a "cloud" of interacting producers and consumers 
of data.  Once they have joined the cloud, they can publish services 
to other members and use methods published by others.  This paper 
presents the initial design of a set of matchmaking components for

ABELS successfully match data producing services to the requests of 
data consuming clients.
	We begin by describing a system for a data producing service 
to describe itself to the ABELS cloud, as well as a corresponding 
system for a data consumer to describe its needs.  We then describe 
in detail the three components that make up the ABELS matchmaking 
system: the match ranker, which ranks a data producer's ability to 
fill the request of a data consumer; the thesaurus, which helps the 
match ranker recognize closely related terms; and the unit database, 
which allows participants in the ABELS system to translate between 
related data units.  We also discuss how these basic components can 
be built upon and improved in future versions of the ABELS framework.">

<b>Abstract:</b>
</P><P>
	The Agent Based Environment for Linking Simulations (ABELS) 
is a software framework designed to provide disparate simulations 
with dynamically updated data sources.  It allows simulations and 
other agents to join a "cloud" of interacting producers and consumers 
of data.  Once they have joined the cloud, they can publish services 
to other members and use methods published by others.  This paper 
presents the initial design of a set of matchmaking components for 
the ABELS framework.  These components dictate how services describe 
their abilities and requirements to ABELS.  Furthermore, they help 
ABELS successfully match data producing services to the requests of 
data consuming clients.
</P><P>
	We begin by describing a system for a data producing service 
to describe itself to the ABELS cloud, as well as a corresponding 
system for a data consumer to describe its needs.  We then describe 
in detail the three components that make up the ABELS matchmaking 
system: the match ranker, which ranks a data producer's ability to 
fill the request of a data consumer; the thesaurus, which helps the 
match ranker recognize closely related terms; and the unit database, 
which allows participants in the ABELS system to translate between 
related data units.  We also discuss how these basic components can 
be built upon and improved in future versions of the ABELS framework.
