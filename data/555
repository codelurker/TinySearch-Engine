<B>Introduction</B> <BR>
Coherently organized tissue has a high degree of diffusional
anisotropy which can be observed non-invasively using diffusion
weighted MRI. DT-MRI has been applied with some success to the in vivo
tracing of white-matter fiber pathways in the brain.  Current
approaches[1,2,3] "grow" pathways by taking steps in the direction
indicated by the diffusion tensor at each point. The noise inherent in
DT-MRI data limits the ability of these stepwise techniques to trace
long fibers in their entirety.

In contrast to these local approaches, we describe a global approach
that employs Expectation Maximization[4] (EM). EM is a statistical
technique that has been used in computer vision to estimate parametric
models from 2-D motion vector fields[5]. Here, we apply EM to the
estimation of neuronal pathways from 3-D tensor fields. EM is an
iterative two stage process for simultaneous data segmentation and
model estimation. In order to employ EM, a set of models are first
defined to describe the data.  In the E-step the probability of every
data point belonging to each model is computed.  In the M-step the
probabilities are used to re-estimate the model parameters.  The E-
and M-steps are repeatedly performed until the probabilities and model
parameters converge to a solution.

<B>Methods</B> <BR>
Subjects were scanned using a 1.5T GE Signa Echospeed (LX8.3) equipped
with 4 G/cm gradients.  Diffusion weighted images were acquired using
a single-shot, diffusion-weighted, spin echo EPI sequence with 6
gradient encoding directions (b=1000).

In our case, the data consisted of a volume of vector-valued data
points (the principle eigenvectors of the apparent diffusion
tensor). The model was taken to be a low-order Bezier curve. A single
run of EM yielded a parametric description of a pathway and a
probability of each point belonging to the pathway. Multiple pathways
were classified after repeated runs with different random starting
conditions.

<B>Results/Discussion</B> <BR>
Using the global probabilistic methods outlined above, we have
successfully traced white matter fiber pathways.  The global nature of
this technique provides several advantages over local approaches: 1)
Fiber tracts can be traced through noisy regions.  2) Longer fiber
tracts can be traced because EM is insensitive to the accumulation of
error found in stepwise solutions.  3) EM provides a measure of the
likelihood of each pathway given the underlying data.  4) Finally, by
fixing both endpoints, pathways connecting two brain regions can be
easily found.

We have presented a method for fiber tracking using EM.  This global
approach can be tailored and extended to provide a valuable tool in
neuroimaging, separately or in concert with existing methods.
