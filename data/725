<b>Public Lab Space:</b>
</big><br>
<p>
There is public lab space available in Sudikoff Room 001 and 003 for students
enrolled in computer science courses. 
You will need to arrange ID-card access to get 
into Sudikoff 001/003 and to get into the building in the evenings
and on weekends. If you don't have that already, you should see
Kelly Clark in 101 Sudikoff.  <b>Don't dawdle; it can take 24 hours
to turn access on.</b>

<b>Late Assignments:</b>
</big><br>
<p>
We have conflicting issues here:
<ul>
<li> Assigments are due when they are due; 
extensions are not fair to the students sufficiently 
diligent to complete their assignments on time.
<li> However, many 
students have interviews and off-campus grad school visits.
</ul>
To balance these issues, here's the policy:
<ul>
<li> Each student has two (virtual) "one-day late" coupons.
Each coupon is good for a 1-day extension on one project.
<li> However, an N-person project requires N coupons for a 1-day extension.
</ul>
Plan accordingly.
<p>
I may otherwise apply 
a "5% off per hour" late policy both to 
the written homework and to the programming projects.

<b>Honor Code:</b>
</big><br>
<p>
The Dartmouth Honor
Code applies to your conduct in this course.  In particular, all
work submitted for credit must be your own.
You may discuss your
homework assignments and programming projects with your classmates, the
course staff, and with me. 
However, you should write up your own written homework solutions
and should not read or copy the solutions written by others (in
this or previous terms, at Dartmouth or elsewhere). 
<p>
You should also write your own code and
not read code written by classmates.
<p>

The Dartmouth College policy on sources also applies to
this course, which means that all sources must be acknowledged,
whether allowed by the instructor or not.  For example, software
given to you by us must be acknowledged 
when incorporated into your work.<br>
<p>
(Whether you go into industry or academia or elsewhere,
it would be good to get in the habit of keeping track of and citing
all your sources anyway!)
<p>
<B>If you have any questions about the
honor code as it relates to CS 108, please come speak with me. 
Violations of the honor code will be treated seriously.</B>

<b>Students with Disabilities:</b>
</big><br>
<p>
I encourage students
with disabilities, including &quot;invisible&quot; disabilities
such as chronic diseases and learning disabilities, to discuss with
me any appropriate accommodations that I might make on their
behalf.
<p>
(If this may apply to you, I also urge you to discuss things with the
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/"><b>Academic Skills
Center</b></a>, if you haven't already.  They've set up a system where
they keep the "appropriate accommodations" on file---so you don't have
to discuss details with each new instructor!)
