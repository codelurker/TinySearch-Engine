8c Renaissance lute after Venere  by Grant Tomlinson, 1996, near mint, 
25 rib striped yew back,  Alpine  spruce  top,  58.4 cm mensur, 
ebony veneered neck/pegbox, rosewood pegs with
bone  pips, Kingham case.  Grant said when he finished this lute
that it was one of his best.  There  are  scriptural  references to what
kind of sin it is to own lutes  of this quality
   that  aren't  being  played enough.  This is an absolutely superb instrument.
No 6 year wait list.  Will add pix as soon as I can figure that  out,
or  email me for pix that I can easily send now.
$6500 firm + insured shipping/packing (  this will be packed very
   well).

Baroque Guitar made by Sebasti&aacute;n N&uacute;&ntilde;ez (2005) for sale.<br>

Based on the famous Quito "vihuela". Back, sides and pegs are made out  
of a piece of "jacaranda" (Brazilian rosewood) from a centuries old  
cabinet. The instrument has a very clear, loud and yet refined sound  
ideal for the spanish and italian repertoire as well as for continuo  
accompaniment. The single parchment rosette and the exotic bridge  
"moustachios" are reconstructions of the original Quito instrument.  
Ebony fingerboard. String length: 68.5 cm.
The reason for selling it is that I never play it anymore since I am  
progressively centering on renaissance lute and vihuela music from the  
XVI century.
The condition of the instrument is as good as new. No scratches or  
blemishes.
The instrument is officially valued by the maker at &euro;4650 (including  
VAT. and case).
PRICE : 3700 Euros<br>

<li>
7 course bandora, mensur 76/80 cm.  Built by Michael Loveridge in 1972.
This was Lyle Nordstrom's instrument for ages.  I have owned it since 2002.
The bandora shows its age, but holds tune well, and sounds resonant,
projective, and sweet.  There is a gap between bridge and face, and when I
bought the instrument I assumed I would have to have it fixed; instead, it
has held steady for the past 7 years.  Also, the a couple ribs in the back
pulled apart, but also, these have been stable in that state for 7 years.
<br>
The case looks like it's been kicked around an airport, and it probably has,
and it is quite heavy, but still protects the instrument well.  Other than
being a fine instrument, the appeal is that this bandora is a fraction the
cost of a new instrument.
<br>
Price:  $1,900.  Buyer pays shipping.  For anyone looking to found or join a
broken consort, this is about as low-cost an entry as you're likely to find.

sale. courses: 1*1+7*2=3D65cm, 1*2=3D68cm, 1*2=3D71cm.<br>

little finger wore out the soundboard is covered now with a small piece 
of very thin spruce), it is in perfectly playable condition and has a 
beautiful sound.
The lute can be checked personally and should presumable be collected in

Six-course lute for sale.<br>
 "Hieber model" made by Dan Larson.
59cm string length, Yew back, veneered neck, Engelmann "AA" quality front.
Aquila nylgut string (+pyramid 5-6 courses-fundamentals) and kingham case.<br>
-Due to its clean tone the lute is ideal for the Italian repertoire especially for two and three-part polyphony.<br>
-It projects incredibly well when performing in venues such as churches or small chapels.  <br>
-The volume is just right, not too powerful but very much reflecting the way such instruments sounded especially after ca. 1535.<br>
-I have paid $ 2,545 (2, 275+ $ 45.00-engelmann front+$225.00-yew back) and I ask the minimum of 1,950 or best offer. The reason I am selling it is simply because I am about to buy two new instruments.<br>

Peter Biffin 6 double coursed baroque guitar.  I have used this guitar as a vihuela in E or as
   a  5 course baroque either ignoring the 6th course or stringing the 5th course with a high A
   and the 6th course with a low A, so as to play various composers who use different tunings.
   Currently the guitar is tuned with all six courses.  A great instrument for Boccherini, Bach
   or Scarlatti transcriptions.  There is also a small repetoire of music for a 6 string baroque
   guitar. It has a cedar top and it is built with lattice bracing similar to Greg Smallman's
   Classical guitars which Peter co-invented with Greg.  A concert instrument.  New $7,500.  Will
   sacrifice for $4,650.  Will consider trades of guitar or lutes instruments.<br>

Stolen lute. The lute in
  question belongs to Marianne Buisseret, Hofstraat 247, 9000 Ghent, Belgium
  (tel: 00 32 9225 9576 contact email: lieven.misschaert@worldonline.be) and
  was recently stolen in Belgium from a lute maker's car. It was on its way to
  be cleaned up so it won't look as pristine as in the photographs, which were
  taken when it was made in 1984.

I'm writing to ask that everyone be on the lookout for a baroque guitar (5
courses) belonging to Lucas Harris in NY.
It was left accidently on the Long Island Rail Road and was taken by someone
on the train. 
It has snakewood back and sides, a red and white rose with the center part
missing so you can actually see the label, which says Ivo Romano 1996, I
believe.  It has a vaulted back.<br>

<a name="howto"></a><h3>How to post an ad</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Send your postings for lutes for sale, or lutes wanted, to
wbc&#64;cs&#046;dartmouth&#046;edu and be sure to include your address (including
country) and phone number.
You also must include an e-mail address where I can reach you.
Please send your ad in plain text format, not in html format!
I generally do not reply to you unless I need more information
but
I try and insert and delete ads as soon as I get them.  
I will delete the ads after roughly one year.
<li>
If you send pictures, try and crop them close to the instrument so people don't
have to wait to download extra picture that they don't need.  
A 200,000 byte picture will take over thirty seconds to download
on a modem connection!
Be sure the pictures are in focus.  Take a few moments to check
in detail.  
Cameras focus better in bright light, so consider taking your
pictures outdoors.
Look at what is in the background of the picture too!
You might not want your dirty laundry in the picture.
It helps if the
names of the pictures don't have any spaces in them.  Use
"baroque-lute.jpg" or "baroqueLute.jpg" instead of "baroque lute.jpg".
If you take a close up picture of the rosette be sure that it is in focus.
<li>
If you are not writing in english, please either use html characters
for accents ( as &amp;eacute;  for &eacute;) or spell it out ( o with " over it, &ouml; )
or use tex symbols ( \'a, &aacute; ) as my word processor does not
recognise accents.  Since I post these ads in my very hard to
come by free moments, it would help me if you send the ad as
"text/plain" format.  If I can't read your ad I will ask you
to re-submit it.
<li> 
If you want to change something, please send me the changes, not the whole ad.
If you say "change the price from 4500 to 4200" or "add a line
that says  ..." I can quickly make the change.  If you send me
a new ad I have to look through the new and old versions to find
the differences, and I may miss something.  If I already have the pictures
please don't send them again!
<li>
I have a very hard time decoding Microsoft Word documents - please send your ad as plain text!
<li>
Please type out the monitary units, as in "yen", "krone", "euro",
or "dollars" as my computer can't read the special symbols that many
people use for money.  If you type in the characters &#38;yen&#59;
you will get a &yen;, and the characters &#38;euro&#59; will 
print &euro;.  The &#38; (ampersand) and &#59; (semicolon) are 
required.  ( if your are british &#38;#163; or &#38;pound; {include the semicolon} will produce the &#163; sign.)
<li>
I use spam filters, if you message looks a lot like spam (html format, 
all capital letters, etc) I may not get it.  If the ad doesn't show up try sending 
it again using plain text, lowercase letters, and a Subject that says
"lute for sale" clearly.
<li>
If you are a professional builder you may list lutes that you currently
have on hand for immediate sale.  Please tell me when the instrument
is sold.
<a name="string"></a>
<li>
This service is free, but if you feel grateful to me for having
found or sold your lute, you can send a 
<a href="payment.html">contribution</a> to
Wayne Cripps, 6211 Sudikoff Lab., Hanover, N.H. 03755 USA.
Please make checks payable to "Wayne Cripps", as the bank gets
upset when I try to cash checks made out to "string fund."
Foreign currencies (cash, not checks) are gladly accepted.
(I seem to be collecting euros now.)
<li>
I tend to change usage to American English without notification.
<li>
Send any questions about the instruments listed here directly 
to the owners.  In some cases, the owners do not have e-mail and
you will have to use the phone or even write to them!
<li>
Please be sure to tell me if you do not want me to list your complete name and
address information.  
It is helpful if people know what country and state the instrument
is in, but it might be safer to omit your street address. 
You should check your ad once I have inserted it.
You might want to consider opening a special email account 
for selling your lute, as you will get mail from Nigerian 
criminals.  It may take a year to sell your lute, and you may
be getting several Nigerian Scam messages a day!
</ul>
<a name="fraud"></a>
<h4>Warning! the Nigerian Fraud has hit the lute world! </h4>
Criminals from Nigeria are contacting people who advertise on this list,
asking to buy a lute with a check for thousands of dollars over
the price of the
lute and have the seller wire the remaining money to Nigeria.
Don't do it - the check will be forged and will bounce -
this is a way to steal your money!   They all seem to know about this 
"Lutes for Sale" list and they <em>will</em> contact you.

See <a href="http://home.rica.net/alphae/419coal/">http://home.rica.net/alphae/419coal/</a>

You may want to get yourself a temporary email address to use just for
selling your lute, so that your regular email is not filled with
messages from people running this scam.
<p>
Here are some signs of fraud:
<ul>
<li>If someone wants to send a check for more than the cost of the instrument and shipping, and wants you to send cash back to them with the instrument for "tax reasons".  The check will bounce and you will be out the money and your instrument.  Even if the bank accepts the check, they will come after you for the money weeks later when they find it is forged.
<li>If someone will deliver a check by courier.  In the USA mail fraud is a serious crime and  thieves use FedEx and Western Union so they won't be investigated and prosecuted by the Post Service.
<li>Watch out for forged bank checks.  If you are suspicious wait a few weeks to be sure that it clears.  Talk to someone at your bank about this.
<li>If someone is buying a lute for somebody else as a present.  Perhaps 
a rich uncle buying something for his nephew.  Or perhaps the person
is acting as an agent.  How many lute players would have an agent
buy a lute for them?  Really!  (watch out for "Mark Luke")
<li>If a third party, not the buyer, is supposed to send the check because
he owes the buyer money.
<li>If someone doesn't ask the usual lute player questions about the age, condition,
and string dimensions, and doesn't ask for pictures.  If someone says
they saw your lute and it is acceptable.  If they don't even mention
lutes, but just ask for information about the article you are selling.
<li>If someone seems to have difficulty writing the language of the
country they claim to come from.
<li>Note also that Indonesia is known for credit card fraud.  Be extremely
cautious when selling something to be paid for with an Indonesian card!
<p>
<a href="sales-rules.html">Here</a>
 is a 
<a href="sales-rules.html">letter </a>that you can send to a prospective buyer if you have any
reason to be suspicious....
