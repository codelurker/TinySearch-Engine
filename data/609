dimensions is NP-complete. We then analyze the effects of two
modifications to the Dimensional Method independently: processing
multiple dimensions at one time, and processing single dimensions in a

    We present an improved version of the Dimensional Method for computing
multidimensional Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) on a multiprocessor
system when the data consist of too many records to fit into

    The simple Dimensional Method performs the 1-dimensional FFTs for
each dimension in term. Between each dimension, an out-of-core
permutation is used to rearrange the data to contiguous locations.
The improved Dimensional Method processes multiple dimensions at a
time.

    We show that determining an optimal sequence and groupings of
dimensions is NP-complete. We then analyze the effects of two
modifications to the Dimensional Method independently: processing
multiple dimensions at one time, and processing single dimensions in a

    Finally, we show a lower bound on the I/O complexity of the
Dimensional Method and present an algorithm that is approximately
