<META NAME="abstract" CONTENT="  Chinese characters are used daily by well over a billion people. They
constitute the main writing system of China and Taiwan, form a major
part of written Japanese, and are also used in South Korea. Anything
more than a cursory glance at these characters will reveal a high
degree of structure to them, but computing systems do not currently
have a means to operate on this structure. Existing character
databases and dictionaries treat them as numerical code points, and
associate with them additional `hand-computed' data, such as stroke
count, stroke order, and other information to aid in specific
searches. Searching by a character's `shape' is effectively impossible
in these systems.
  I propose a new approach to representing these characters, through an
XML-based language called SCML. This language, by encoding an abstract
form of a character, allows the direct retrieval of important
information such as stroke count and stroke order, and permits useful
but previously impossible automated analysis of characters. In
addition, the system allows the design of a view that takes abstract
SCML representations as character models and outputs glyphs based on
an aesthetic, facilitating the creation of `meta-fonts' for Chinese
characters. Finally, through the creation of a specialized database,
SCML allows for efficient structural character queries to be performed
against the body of inserted characters, thus allowing people to
search by the most obvious of a character's characteristics: its
shape.">

  Chinese characters are used daily by well over a billion people. They
constitute the main writing system of China and Taiwan, form a major
part of written Japanese, and are also used in South Korea. Anything
more than a cursory glance at these characters will reveal a high
degree of structure to them, but computing systems do not currently
have a means to operate on this structure. Existing character
databases and dictionaries treat them as numerical code points, and
associate with them additional `hand-computed' data, such as stroke
count, stroke order, and other information to aid in specific
searches. Searching by a character's `shape' is effectively impossible
in these systems.
</P><P>
  I propose a new approach to representing these characters, through an
XML-based language called SCML. This language, by encoding an abstract
form of a character, allows the direct retrieval of important
information such as stroke count and stroke order, and permits useful
but previously impossible automated analysis of characters. In
addition, the system allows the design of a view that takes abstract
SCML representations as character models and outputs glyphs based on
an aesthetic, facilitating the creation of `meta-fonts' for Chinese
characters. Finally, through the creation of a specialized database,
SCML allows for efficient structural character queries to be performed
against the body of inserted characters, thus allowing people to
search by the most obvious of a character's characteristics: its
shape.
