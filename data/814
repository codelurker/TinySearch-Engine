<META NAME="abstract" CONTENT=" A secure system that cannot be used by real users to secure
real-world processes is not really secure at all. While many believe
that usability and security are diametrically opposed, a growing body
of research from the field of Human-Computer Interaction and Security
(HCISEC) refutes this assumption. All researchers in this field agree
that focusing on aligning usability and security goals can enable the
design of systems that will be more secure under actual usage.
  We bring to bear tools from the social sciences (economics, sociology,
psychology, etc.)  not only to help us better understand why deployed
systems fail, but also to enable us to accurately characterize the
problems that we must solve in order to build systems that will be
secure in the real world. Trust, a critically important facet of any
socio-technical secure system, is ripe for analysis using the tools
provided for us by the social sciences.
 There are a variety of scopes in which issues of trust in secure
systems can be stud- ied. We have chosen to focus on how humans decide
to trust new correspondents. Current secure email systems—such as
S/MIME and PGP/MIME—are not expressive enough to capture the real ways
that trust flows in these sorts of scenarios. To solve this problem,
we begin by applying concepts from social science research to a
variety of such cases from interesting application domains; primarily,
crisis management in the North American power grid. We have examined
transcripts of telephone calls made between grid manage- ment
personnel during the August 2003 North American blackout and extracted
several different classes of trust flows from these real-world
scenarios. Combining this knowl- edge with some design patterns from
HCISEC, we develop criteria for a system that will enable humans apply
these same methods of trust-building in the digital world. We then
present Attribute-Based, Usefully Secure Email (ABUSE) and not only
show that it meets our criteria, but also provide empirical evidence
that real users are helped by the system.  ">

 A secure system that cannot be used by real users to secure
real-world processes is not really secure at all. While many believe
that usability and security are diametrically opposed, a growing body
of research from the field of Human-Computer Interaction and Security
(HCISEC) refutes this assumption. All researchers in this field agree
that focusing on aligning usability and security goals can enable the
design of systems that will be more secure under actual usage.

  We bring to bear tools from the social sciences (economics, sociology,

problems that we must solve in order to build systems that will be
secure in the real world. Trust, a critically important facet of any

 There are a variety of scopes in which issues of trust in secure
