<p>With the extensive development of genomic sequencing and rapid
protein expression, there are now many more targets available for
protein structure determination than can be completed by even the most
advanced automated methods.  Many of these targets also present
well-known experimental difficulties for the traditional methods of
crystallography and NMR.  However, help in interpreting the genomic
data is available from computational techniques that use knowledge
extracted from the database of experimentally determined structures,
in order to predict structures for proteins with different sequences.
The effective use of these computational techniques would be greatly
enhanced by the ability to rapidly discriminate among and confirm
predictions with experimental data that can be acquired rapidly and
easily.  For example, appropriate experimental methods can provide
measurements of distance (e.g. by chemical cross-linking of specific
residues), assays of residue accessibility (e.g. by chemical
modification of surface residues), and low-resolution
characterizations of shape (e.g. by solution scattering).</p>

<p>We are developing a comprehensive computational-experimental
protocol for the rapid discrimination of predicted protein structure
via multiple modes of experimental data.  The multimodal
discrimination approach poses challenging computational problems in
combining rather sparse, noisy information from different experimental
methods and describing quantitatively the extent of discrimination
provided.  Associated reasoning algorithms overcome problems of noise
and sparsity by uncovering consistent sets of features, targeting
clarifying queries in response to conflicts, and planning additional
experiments.</p>
