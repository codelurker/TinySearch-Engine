<b>Purpose:</b> Work. I'm a sysadmin. People ask, "What do you<br>
actually do?" Well lots of stuff. Basically its administering<br>
the computer system, ie. making sure all the computers work,<br>
that email works, that peoples files are accessible, that<br>
programs work, that the network works, database admin stuff, doing<br>
backups, programming, automating maintenance stuff, helping<br>
users use their computers, learning new languages, trying to<br>
keep up, staring at computer screens, drinking too much coffee,<br>
listening to too many mp3s, fooling around with new toys (I mean<br>
learning new technology), reading news groups, reading email,<br>
daydreaming about my next ski day, editing my webpage or resume,<br>
changing my background, searching the web for important information,<br>
IMing, decorating my office, daydreaming about having a life, <br>
etc...
