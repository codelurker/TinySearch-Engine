<title>Dynamic Geometry</title>
<h2>Dynamic geometry</h2>
Animated and interactive geometry is often used
pedagogically for "discovery" or to provide
vivid circumstantial evidence for theorems, as in
the inexorable concurrence of medians or the amazing
<a href="http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Geometry/Feuerbach.shtml">
Feuerbach tangencies</a>.
The demonstrations below, however, use dynamic
geometry not only as an aid to insight, but also as a
proof technique <i>per se</i>.

this proof much more engaging than
visualizations of static Euclidean proofs of this theorem,
which abound on the Internet.

icosahedron.</a>  This short modern proof
told to me by Peter Doyle
stands in dramatic contrast to the

in the culminating book
of Euclid's <i>Elements</i>,
