<b>Abstract:</b>
</P><P>
  The Panda Array I/O library, created at the University of Illinois,
Urbana-Champaign, was built especially to address the needs of high-performance
scientific applications. I/O has been one of the most frustrating bottlenecks
to high performance for quite some time, and the Panda project is an attempt to
ameliorate this problem while still providing the user with a simple,
high-level interface. The Galley File System, with its hierarchical structure
of files and strided requests, is another attempt at addressing the performance
problem. My project was to redesign the Panda Array library for use on the
Galley file system. This project involved porting Panda's three main functions:
a checkpoint function for writing a large array periodically for 'safekeeping,'
a restart function that would allow a checkpointed file to be read back in, and
finally a timestep function that would allow the user to write a group of large
arrays several times in a sequence. Panda supports several different
distributions in both the compute-node memories and I/O-node disks.

  We have found that the Galley File System provides a good environment
on which to build high-performance libraries, and that the mesh of Panda and
Galley was a successful combination.
