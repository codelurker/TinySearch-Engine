<META NAME="abstract" CONTENT="       To improve MRI acquisition time, we explored the uses of linear
discriminant analysis (LDA), and local discriminant bases (LDB) for
the task of classifying MRI images using a minimal set of signal
acquisitions.
       Our algorithm has both off-line and on-line components.  The
off-line component uses the k-basis algorithm to partition a set of
training images (all from a particular region of a patient) into
classes.  For each class, we find a basis by applying the best basis
algorithm on the images in that class.  We keep these bases to be used
by the on-line process.  We then apply LDB to the training set with
the class assignments, determining the best discriminant basis for the
set.  We rank the basis coordinates according to discriminating power,
and retain the top M coordinates for the on-line algorithm.  We keep
the top M coordinates, which index the basis functions with the most
discriminating capability, for on-line purposes.  Finally, we train
LDA on these transformed coordinates, producing a classifier for the
images.
       With the off-line requirements complete, we can take advantage
of the simplicity and speed of the on-line mechanism to acquire an
image in a similar region of the patient.  We need acquire only the M
important coordinates of the image in the discriminant basis to create
a ``scout image.''  This image, which can be acquired quickly since M
is much much smaller than the number of measurements needed to fill in
the values of the 256 by 256 pixels, is then sent through the map
furnished by LDA which in turn assigns a class to the image.
Returning to the list of bases that we kept from the k-bases
algorithm, we find the optimal basis for the particular class at hand.
We then acquire the image using that optimal basis, omitting the
coefficients with the least truncation error.  The complete image can
then be quickly reconstructed using the inverse wavelet packet
transform.
       The power of our algorithm is that the on-line task is fast and
simple, while the computational complexity lies mostly in the off-line
task that needs to be done only once for images in a certain region.
In addition, our algorithm only makes use of the flexibility of MRI
hardware, so no modifications in hardware design are needed.">

</P><P>
       To improve MRI acquisition time, we explored the uses of linear
discriminant analysis (LDA), and local discriminant bases (LDB) for
the task of classifying MRI images using a minimal set of signal
acquisitions.
</P><P>
       Our algorithm has both off-line and on-line components.  The
off-line component uses the k-basis algorithm to partition a set of
training images (all from a particular region of a patient) into
classes.  For each class, we find a basis by applying the best basis
algorithm on the images in that class.  We keep these bases to be used
by the on-line process.  We then apply LDB to the training set with
the class assignments, determining the best discriminant basis for the
set.  We rank the basis coordinates according to discriminating power,
and retain the top M coordinates for the on-line algorithm.  We keep
the top M coordinates, which index the basis functions with the most
discriminating capability, for on-line purposes.  Finally, we train
LDA on these transformed coordinates, producing a classifier for the
images.
</P><P>
       With the off-line requirements complete, we can take advantage
of the simplicity and speed of the on-line mechanism to acquire an
image in a similar region of the patient.  We need acquire only the M
important coordinates of the image in the discriminant basis to create
a ``scout image.''  This image, which can be acquired quickly since M
is much much smaller than the number of measurements needed to fill in
the values of the 256 by 256 pixels, is then sent through the map
furnished by LDA which in turn assigns a class to the image.
Returning to the list of bases that we kept from the k-bases
algorithm, we find the optimal basis for the particular class at hand.
We then acquire the image using that optimal basis, omitting the

then be quickly reconstructed using the inverse wavelet packet

       The power of our algorithm is that the on-line task is fast and
