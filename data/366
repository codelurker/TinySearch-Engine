            <p>"THE riddle does not exist. If a question can be put at all, then it can also be answered." Presumably this remark by philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein is a sick joke at the expense of mathematicians, who frequently spend their whole careers clawing at unyielding riddles. And who can blame them for persevering with exquisite torments like the 150-year-old Riemann hypothesis?</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>It may be an arcane puzzle about the array of prime numbers, but the Riemann hypothesis is also hugely important, and its story has spawned many excellent books. Dan Rockmore's <i>Stalking the Riemann Hypothesis</i> is a fine addition. Much of the content may be familiar, but Rockmore's style, emphasis and language are all admirably fresh, and it is fully accessible to non-specialists. Of course, we are still waiting for the final chapter in the story - that someone proves the hypothesis - but Rockmore is an excellent guide to take you right to the edge of the mathematical map, and he's bang up to date.</p>
