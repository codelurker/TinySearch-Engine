<b> Year in Review: 2008 </b>
<p>

I hope that this email finds you all well.  I write to update you on
the happenings of the <a href="group.html">Image Science Group</a>.
The group currently consists of Dan Hopkins, Eric Kee, Weihong Wang,
and Jeff Woodward.  Our lab has had a fun and productive year.  Our
main focus continues to be in the area of digital forensics, in which,
thanks to all of you, we have made incredible advances.

We welcome Dan Hopkins '10 to our lab. Dan took CS 36/136 (Numerical
and Computational Tools) with me this summer, and I was so impressed
with him that I asked him to join our group.  Dan is working on how to
locally estimate, from a single image, signal to noise ratio. If
successful this will prove to be a powerful forensic tools for
detecting differences in sensor noise, additive noise, or JPEG
quality.

<a href=http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~erickee>Eric Kee</a> bravely dove
into the relatively new area of document forensics. In our first
published work in this area, Eric showed that different printers
introduce distinct distortions into the printed characters, and that
these distortions can be used to detect inconsistencies across a
document, and for ballistic purposes -- that of linking a document to
a printer.

Eric is currently slugging through some difficult, but very exciting,
new work that I think will raise our work in digital image forensics
to an entirely new level of sophistication... stay tuned...

Building on his earlier work, <a
href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~whwang/">Weihong Wang</a> continues
to develop new video forensic tools.  In his most recent paper,
Weihong developed a clever geometric algorithm for detecting boot-leg
video that was recorded from a movie screen.

To give some intution behind this technique, consider this scene from
the movie <i>Live Free Or Die Hard</i> as viewed from the side of the
movie theater.  Notice that the rectangular screen will be imaged with
perspective distortion. Weihong has shown that when recorded from such
a position, the projected movie contains very specific distortions in
the intrinsic camera matrix -- namely the camera skew is
non-zero. These distortions can be used to detect such re-recorded
video.

Jeff Woodward (Woody) continues to port all of our forensic tools from
Matlab into a stand-alone software package.  We delivered this
software to the FBI's forensic lab in March of 2008, and continue to
expand on this software to include both image and video forensic
applications.

<p>
<HR>
<p>

In large part due to your efforts, the field of digital image
forensics has matured to the extent that special journal issues have
begun to appear.  Here is a survey paper on image forgery detection
that will appear in a special journal issue on digital forensics.

<HR>
<p>

As for me, most significantly, I have been named the director of
the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~neukom">Neukom Institute for
Computational Science</a> at Dartmouth whose broad mandate is to
support scholarship and curricular development in the computational
sciences, social sciences, and humanities.

<BR><BR>

As always, you can find on my web page copies of
our <a href="publications/publications.html">papers</a>
and <a href="publications/publications.html#popularpress">popular
press</a> accounts of our work.  And you can see a short
<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sciencenow/0301/03.html">profile</a>
about me and our lab's work that appeared on NOVA ScienceNow (watch
for cameo appearances by Kimo, Eric, Weihong, and Woody).

In alumni news, 
<ul>

<li> <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~kimo">Kimo Johnson</a> is finishing
his first year of post-doctoral work at MIT and Adobe Labs, where he
is working on a wide variety of topics.

<li> <a href="http://www.cs.albany.edu/~lsw/">Siwei Lyu</a> accepted a
position at SUNY Albany as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science.
Sadly, I will be a "grandfather" to Siwei's first Ph.D. student.

<li> Senthil Periaswamy is working at iCAD in Ohio where he continues
to do interesting work in medical imaging, and is now director of his
own group.

<li> Alin Popescu continues to work at Renesys Inc. here in Hanover,
NH.

<li> <a href="http://www.jethrofilms.com">Jethro Rothe-Kushel</a> has
been living in Los Angeles, CA and working in various corners of the
movie industry. I am thrilled that Jethro has agreed to handle all of
the multi-media needs for me in my role as director of the Neukom
Institute for Computational Science.

<li> Kate Sherwin is in Austin, TX where she continues to work in the
field of computational finance. Kate spent a few days with me in Santa
Cruz this Spring where we joyously (for me at least) talked
mathematics. You are all welcome to visit me anytime.

I hope that this email finds you all well and happy.  Please stay in
touch and let me know how things are.
