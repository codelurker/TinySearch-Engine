<h2>Announcements</h2>
<p>We will not have class on Saturday Janury 6th.</p>

<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>This course provides an overview of some of the most interesting topics 
in computing and computer science, from how the World-Wide Web works all the 
way down to how a computer processes individual ones and zeros. 
We will study computing topics through the lens of HTML and JavaScript, 
two of the more important technologies behind the World-Wide Web. 
You will learn how to make web pages that present information, 
and how to write scripts that interact with the users of your pages. 
We will also cover current topics in computing, such as web searching, 
computer animation, robotics, and bioinformatics. </p>

<p>Note: CS 4 is not a "computer literacy" course. 
We will not learn how to use general application software such as word processors, 
spreadsheets, or e-mail programs; our intent is to give you a clear survey of 
computer science, plus some practical experience in applying the concepts you've learned.</p>

<h2>Coursework and Grading</h2>

<p>
The class will have homeworks, and a midterm and final.
The schedule page will contain an up-to-date list of homeworks and due dates.
</p>

<h3>Homeworks</h3>

<p>
The homeworks will be due at the beginning of class on Fridays, unless otherwise noted,
with answers either printer or clearly written.
<em>Late homeworks will not be accepted for credit.</em>
Exception to this rule might be made for special cases only if the professor 
is informed way before the deadline and at his sole discretion.
</p>

<p>For both written questions and programming problems, you must hand in hard-copy 
of your solutions. When turning in homework assignments, 
write your name on each piece of your submission, and turn them in enclosed in a 
manila envelope which has your name written prominently on it.</p>

<p>
In order to complete the HTML/JavaScript homeworks you will need to:
</p>
<ol>
	<li> <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~apply">Apply for personal web space</a> 
		on the Dartmouth web server. Do this as soon as possible, 
		as it may take several days for your account to be created. </li>
    <li> Create a "private" folder within your personal web space for your 
         CS 4 homework. Name the folder something like cs4Q8294 -- that is, 
         append to cs4 a letter (upper or lower case) followed by four numbers 
         (non-sequential, e.g., don't use 1234). 
         Your choice of a code name for this folder will make it unlikely that 
         anybody can casually stumble onto your homework. 
         Needless to say, it is a violation of the honor code to copy anything 
         from another student's web page. 
         When submitting your homework, make sure to write down your full URL 
         (including the 5 character code), so that your TA will be able to access your homework. </li>
    <li> Install a version of <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Firefox 2</a>. 
    	Note that there are differences between the various web browsers, 
    	and you must make sure that your code works on Firefox 2, 
    	as this is what the TAs will be using to grade your homeworks. </li>
</ol>

<p>
For homework assignments including an HTML/JavaScript component, 
in addition to turning in a hard-copy, you must also do the following:</p>

<ol>
   <li> On each web page, include a piece of JavaScript code that will 
   <a href="timestamp.html">time stamp</a> your assignment. </li>
   <li> <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/web/accounts/access.html">Upload</a> 
   your web pages to the Dartmouth web server, in your "private" folder (see above). </li>
   <li> Write or print the URL of the page you are submitting, on top of the hard copy of your homework. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Lab</h3>

<p>
Sudikoff 005 has a number of Macintosh computers that are available for your use. 
During the scheduled hours, these computers are reserved for CS 4 students. 
You may use the lab at other times as long as it is not reserved for other uses, 
although during unscheduled hours, you might have to share the lab with students 
from other courses, and course staff will not be available. 
To get your ID card enabled for access to this lab (and to Sudikoff after-hours), 
see Kelly Clark in 101 Sudikoff on a weekday between 8:30am-12:00pm or 1:00-3:30pm. 
</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>
The grade will be rougly based on homeworks (30% total), midterm exam (35 %) and final (35%).
</p>

<p> For exceptionally creative and interesting work, it is possible to receive extra credit points. 
Extra credit is tallied separately from the regular grades on homework and exams, 
and is used to adjust final grades after the final average is computed.
Extra credit is not assigned as part of the regular homework problems, 
but the course staff will be on the lookout for clever and creative work that you have 
done above and beyond the normal assignments given.
</p>

<h2>Policies</h2>

<h3>Honor Code</h3>

<p>On examinations in this course (either midterm or final), you may not collaborate with, 
copy from, or otherwise share information with any other students.</p>

<p>For homework problems (but not examinations), you may discuss general approaches 
with your classmates, before you have written your solutions, and you may help each 
other find bugs in each other's code. However, your code and any other solutions 
you submit must be created, written/typed, and documented by you alone; 
any copying (electronic or otherwise) of another person's code or solutions, 
in whole or in part, is a violation of the Honor Code.</p>

<p>If you make use of any code taken from outside references -- for instance, 
from an off-site web page or a textbook other than the ones used for this course -- 
you must clearly attribute the source of the code with clear comments in the code that 
you submit. Code from class examples, the course textbooks, or the homework assignments, 
does not have to be attributed. Note also that proper respect for copyright laws as applied 
to printed materials and software products is subsumed by Dartmouth College's 
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/comp/about/policies/">Computing Policies</a>.</p>

<p>If you have any questions as to whether some action would be acceptable under the 
Academic Honor Code, please speak to me or another member of the course staff, 
and we will be glad to help clarify things. 
It is always easier to ask beforehand than to have trouble later.</p>

<h3>Disabilities</h3>

<p>I encourage any students with disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities such 
as chronic diseases and learning disabilities, to discuss appropriate accommodations 
with me, which might help you with this class, either after class or during office hours. 
Dartmouth College has an active program to help students with disabilities, 
and I am happy to do whatever I can to help out, as appropriate.</p>

<p>The Student Disabilities Coordinator, Nancy Pompian, can be reached at 6-2014 if you 
have any questions. Any student with a documented disability requiring academic adjustments 
or accommodations is requested to speak with me by the second week of the term. 
All discussions will remain confidential. It is important, however, 
that you talk to me soon, so that I can make whatever arrangements might 
be needed in a timely fashion.</p>
