<b> Year in Review: 2005 </b>
<p>

I hope that this email finds you all well.  I write to update you on
the happenings of the <a href="group.html">Image Science Group</a>.
At various times this year, the group consisted of Kimo Johnson, Siwei
Lyu, Weihong Wang and Jeff Woodward.

<p>
<HR>
<p>

<a href="http://www.cs.albany.edu/~lsw/">Siwei Lyu</a> defended his
Ph.D. dissertation on a general-purpose statistical model for natural
images with applications to digital image forensics.  Two applications
in digital image forensics include stenganalysis and differentiating
between photographic and computer generated images:

<p>

<dd> Steganalysis Using Higher-Order Image Statistics </dd> 
<dd> S. Lyu and H. Farid </dd>
<dd> IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 2005 (in press) </dd> 
<dd> <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/publications/tifs05.html">
     http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/publications/tifs05.html</a> </dd>

<p>

<dd> How Realistic is Photorealistic? </dd>
<dd> S. Lyu and H. Farid  </dd>
<dd> IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 53(2):845-850, 2005 </dd>
<dd> <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/publications/sp05b.html">
     http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/publications/sp05b.html</a> </dd>
<p>

And Siwei's dissertation, <a
 href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/publications/slthesis05.html">
Natural Image Statistics for Digital Image Forensics </a> is available on-line.
<p>

While it was very difficult to say goodbye to Siwei, I am thrilled to
report that he is currently a postdoc at NYU working with Eero
Simoncelli in the Center for Neural Science and Department of
Mathematics.  Siwei continues to work in the general area of natural
image statistics as well as exploring new areas in, among others,
computational neuroscience.  We look forward to seeing great things
from Siwei over the years.

<a href="http://www.mit.edu/~kimo/">Kimo Johnson</a> has also been
working in the area of digital image forensics and has been developing
some very nice and powerful techniques for detecting doctored photos.
The first paper describes a technique for detecting inconsistencies in
lighting that might emerge when creating a digital composite:

<p>

<dd> Exposing Digital Forgeries by Detecting Inconsistencies in Lighting  </dd>
<dd> M.K. Johnson and H. Farid  </dd>
<dd> ACM Multimedia and Security Workshop, New York, NY, 2005 </dd>
<dd> <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/publications/acm05.html">
     http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/publications/acm05.html</a> </dd>

<p>

Kimo is currently working on several other light/optics based
techniques, that I am hopeful will eventually lead to techniques for
camera ballistics -- that of identifying a specific or type of camera
from an image.

<a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~whwang/">Weihong Wang</a> joined the
group this year and has begun an ambitious project of expanding our
forensic work to digital video.  We are currently writing up our first
set of results and have several promising ideas that we are
developing.  I expect this to be an important and exciting new
research direction.

<p>
<HR>
<p>

Jeff Woodward joined the group the year as a part-time programmer.
Jeff is porting all of our image forensic matlab code into Java (the
code will be incorporated as plugins into the open source ImageJ).
This project is part of grant from the FBI, and these tools will
eventually be incorporated into the FBI digital forensic lab.  Along
the way, Jeff is helping us to refine and rethink all of our ideas,
leading to many important computational and algorithmic improvements.

As for me, most significantly, I have spent the Spring and Fall term
in Santa Cruz, CA.  During both terms I worked with the Adobe
Photoshop team (San Jose, CA) exploring possible collaborative work in
digital forensics and in other areas of general scientific computing.
While it is, at times, difficult to be away from Dartmouth, this has
been a wonderful opportunity for me to have time to think, read, write
and explore new research directions.

<p>

Life on the west coast is, of course, a mixture of work and play.  I
have spent a little bit of time photographing the beautiful landscape,
particularly along the pacific coast.  Below is a thumbnail of a
17,251 x 2,496 pixel composite seamed together from five individual
images.

In alumni news, David Martin is working as a system engineer at Wily
Technologies near San Francisco.  Joe Pechter started Dental School at
Tufts and Will Pechter is finishing his masters' program at Florida
Atlantic University.  Senthil Periaswamy has been doing some exciting
work at Siemens in medical imaging and is now the proud father of his
second child, Smrithi. Alin Popescu has taken a job at Renesys here in
Hanover working in the area of network systems and security.  Jethro
Rothe-Kushel is in Los Angeles producing movies (check out some of his
cool work at <a
href="http://www.jethrofilms.com/">www.jethrofilms.com</a>). Kate
Sherwin is back on the east coast (thankfully in one piece) after many
years of competitive bicycle racing, working in the tech industry.
And Hai Sun is finishing up the M.D. portion of his M.D./Ph.D.
