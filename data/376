SIZE=1>ELL,</FONT> it's finally happened. The
fragrance industry has discovered "math appeal." Givenchy has a new
men's cologne called Pi. In a recent National Public Radio segment, the
reporter David Kestenbaurn attributed the name of this new scent to the
public's growing love of technology, and the perception of
technology--and hence mathematics and numbers--as cool. <BR><BR>

But maybe we're not giving Givenchy enough credit.
Was it just some marketing intuition on the company's part that brought
about the fragrance Pi, or was it a more subtle appreciation of the
number in and of itself9 Because if any number were poised to make a
fashion statement, it would be pi.<BR><BR>

To begin with, this is a number that has an exotic
Greek name, and it's one-word appellation echoes the sexy Madonna, Cher,
and Fabio. Of course, when we refer to pi in writing, we use a delicate
and mysterious symbol, just as we do for the artist formerly known as
Prince. In addition, pi is already famous to people around the world,
recognized since 2000 </FONT><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=1>B.C.</FONT> 
as the ratio of the circumference of any circle to
its diameter. That is, take any circle, and measure the distance
around--that's the circumference. Then compare that to the diameter--the
distance across when you go through the center. What you'll find is that
you need just a little more than three times the diameter to get the
circumference--and the exact number of diameters you need is pi. That is
true for every circle. Pi is universal! 
<BR><BR>
So exactly what number is pi?

		Well, as with many alluring things, pi is hard to pin
down. You see, pi is an "irrational" number. That means that when you
figure out pi's decimal expansion--that is, calculate its value beyond the
decimal point--you find that pi is full of surprises. If pi were
"rational"--in other words, a fraction--we would get either an expansion
that stopped somewhere, such as 3.14, or one that repeated itself,<BR><BR>

		such as
3.141414. But, instead, the list of digits that we get seems so
arbitrary as to be almost whimsical. There is no telling what will come
next, as you try to calculate its exact value.<BR><BR>

 But to say simply that pi is irrational doesn't even
begin to speak to the difficulty we have in describing pi. Its

		ability is cabalistic and mysterious, for, even more
than irrational, pi is "transcendental." Although some irrational
numbers satisfy the simple relations of a polynomial (meaning that some
combination of their powers add up to zero, in which case they are
"algebraic"), the powers of pi are not subject to such simple coercion.
One might even say, as mathematicians do, that they are independent!<BR><BR>

Foreign, unpredictable, otherworldly, yet as common
as a circle, the number pi teases and tempts us--it's easy to find, but
hard to know. Why, among mathematicians there still rages a fierce,
unsettled debate about whether pi is a "normal" number--that is, whether
the digits 0 through 9 each occur on average one-tenth of the time in
the never-ending decimal expansion of pi. The questions that surround
pi's normalcy make it a veritable poster number for the fashion world's
ambiguous and androgynous advertising campaigns.<BR><BR>

So that's pi--an exotic, sensual paradox. Surely
Givenchy must have known that this tiny name contained such a wealth of
meaning and emotion. And, just think, there is an infinity of other
numbers out there with similar qualities from which the fragrance and
fashion world may choose. I suppose that if Pi is a hit, we may even
begin to see fragrances named after functions. Of course, you need look
no further than trigonometry to find two likely candidates: tan and
sin.<BR><BR>
