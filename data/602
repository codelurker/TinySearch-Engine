<b>Abstract:</b>
Evaluating retrieval systems, such as those submitted to the
annual TREC competition, usually requires a large number of
documents to be read and judged for relevance to query
topics. Test collections are far too big to be exhaustively
judged, so only a subset of documents is selected to form 
the judgment ``pool.'' The selection method that TREC uses
produces pools that are still quite large. Research has
indicated that it is possible to rank the retrieval systems
correctly using substantially smaller pools. 
</P><P>
  This paper introduces an active learning algorithm whose
goal is to reach the correct rankings using the smallest
possible number of relevance judgments. It adds one document
to the pool at a time, always trying to select the document
with the highest information gain. Several variants of this
algorithm are described, each with improvements on the one
before. Results from experiments are included for comparison
with the traditional TREC pooling method. The best version
of the algorithm reliably outperforms the traditional
method, although its degree of improvement varies.
