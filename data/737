<br />



<span style="font-weight: bold;">Paper Presentation</span><br />





You will be required to present a few of the papers that are being
discussed during the course. Presentations should clearly address the paper's motivation, the
research contribution - specifically addressing the strengths and
weaknesses, and the results. <br />





<br />





Depending on the depth and difficulty of the
paper, make your presentation about 20-30 minutes long. We encourage you
to take a more investigate approach - what makes this paper
interesting? How could you do better? Think about the pros and cons
from different angle - usability, computational efficiency, complexity,
accuracy, and richness of the system or algorithm. The presentations
should be done using powerpoint or some other presentation software of
your
choice - we will request you to give us either a .ppt or .pdf version of
your slides.<br />





<br />





<span style="font-weight: bold;">Project Plan</span><br />





Each group is required to submit a 1-2 page plan for the
