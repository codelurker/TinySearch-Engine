<b>Abstract:</b>
Mobile agents are programs that can migrate from machine to machine in a network of computers and have complete control over their movement. Since the performance space of mobile agents has not been characterized fully, assessing the effectiveness of using mobile agents over a traditional client/server approach currently requires implementing an agent system and running time-consuming experiments.

  This report presents a simple mobile-agent simulation that can provide quick information on the performance and scalability of a generic information retrieval (IR) mobile-agent system under different network configurations. The simulation is built using the DaSSF and DaSSFNet frameworks, resulting in high performance and great configuration flexibility. This report also implements a real D'Agents mobile-agent IR system, measuring the performance of the system. A comparison of these real-world performance results and those given by the simulation suggest that the simulation has good accuracy in predicting the scalability of a mobile-agent system. Thus this report argues that simulation provides a good way to quickly assess the performance and scalability of an IR mobile-agent system under different network configurations.
