<h2><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Course</span></h2>








Welcome to the world on&nbsp;computer networks.&nbsp;Ever wondered what
makes the Internet tick? Want to gain the skills that would allow you
to implement the Internet? Read on ....<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>












<br>












The ORC: This course focuses on the communications protocols used in
computer networks: their functionality, specification, verification,
implementation, and performance; and how protocols work together to
provide more complex services. Aspects of network architectures are
also considered. Laboratory projects are an integral part of the course
in which networking concepts are explored in depth.<br>












<br>












Prerequisite: CS 23 and CS 37. You need strong C and Unix (shell
programming, gdb, cvs, process, threads) skills (taught in CS 23) to do
this course. All programming assignments and project are in C and
Unix.&nbsp; <br>












<br>








Topics covered in this course include network applications (e.g.,
peer-to-peer applications such as BitTorrent), TCP and UDP transport
protocols, flow control, congestion control, the IP protocol, routing
algorithms, medium access layer (e.g., IEEE 802.11 wireless MAC) and
Internet infrastructure such as domain name system (DNS) - these
comprise the Internet's core components. <br>












<br>












There is a significant amount of programming in
this course&nbsp;requiring a significant time commitment on the part of the student. <br>
























<br>






The course breaks down
into lectures, labs, and a course
project - note, there are no exams for this class, i.e., no mid term
and no final. We focus on network programming. The projects will run
for the last two weeks of the course.
There will be no lectures during the last week of the course so
students can fully focus on their group projects. The projects will be
organized around a design review, code review and demo or die event.</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">

























<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>








The course will include seven stepwise programming assignments based
around building
your own P2P IM system, implementing the Simple Reliable Transport
protocol (SRT), Simple Network Protocol (SNP) (including packet
forwarding and
routing) and Overlay Network (ON). Collectively, we call the transport,
network, and overlay
software system <span style="font-weight: bold;">DartNet</span>. <br>








<br>











Students will implement DartNet over the course of the programming
assignments and then "put it all together" so that their IM application
uses their transport and network layer running over an IP overlay
network which students also code. Development of DartNet gives
students a knowledge base and skill set that mirrors what computer
protocol developers execute in industry.</span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"> So<br>








</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">each
student will run their IM app over their transport and routed network
that they build - huge insights will be gained in doing this.</span></span> And, believe me when you tell people that you did this as<br>








an undergrad, even at <a href="http://www.cisco.com/">Cisco</a>, they'll be way impressed!<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
Having
worked in the software networking industry for a decade before falling
into academia I'm a big believer in implementing networking software as
the essential part of fully understanding complex computer networks -
such as, the Internet &nbsp;- else, things remain too abstract.&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">You will write approximately <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/%7Ecampbell/cs78/assignments.html">3000 lines of C code for the assignments and 3500 lines&nbsp;for the group &nbsp;project </a>(shared between the group members). </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">&nbsp;Note,
there is some code reuse for the DartNet set of labs. As a result you
will tangible programming experience in building a network app, and
coding&nbsp;transport and network </span>software.<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"> If you code it
and you'll understand it. Or as Internet pionneer <a href="http://www.csail.mit.edu/people/David_Clark/">David Clark</a> famously put it: <span style="font-style: italic;">"We reject kings, presidents, and voting. We believe in rough consensus and running code.". </span>David was refering to the working practice of how the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) </a>went about developing the core Internet standards. <br>








</span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>











This is an exciting and demand set of experiments that will
reinforce concepts taught in class through network programming assignments.
This is the second time we have done this so we will cut you some slack
and hope you will reciprocate as we "debug" any issues that come up.<br>












<br>








The group project (approx. 4 people in each groups - the lecturer will
set up the groups) will use the wireless Nokia Internet Tablets (below)
which runs embedded Linux. You will program these devices using socket
programming. We will provide each group with one or two tablets each and define
a common project goal that students can build from. More on that as the
course progresses. We plan to have you implement some research ideas we
have developed in the <a href="http://sensorlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/">SensorLab</a> - bring research into the classroom,
it's cutting edge.</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"></span></span><br>

<h2><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Grading</span></h2>























<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">10% &nbsp;Class and lab participation</span> - jump in, get involved, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">be a good CS78 citizen.</span><br>



<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">








<br>



</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">


























There will be a
discussion in class regarding the course reading material. Active
involvement in that discussion, the classs, the lab - will help toward the class contribution
part of the grade.<br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">














</span>















<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>



</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">



70% - Laboratory exercises</span> (10% for each of the 7 labs)</span><br>























<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>



There are 7 weekly laboratory assignments over the first 8 weeks. 10%
is given for each lab. Some labs are harder than others but we have
a flat grading scheme across all labs. These assignments are to be done
individually. The schedule is online&nbsp;- plan a head. You need to be
organized to get through the labs and stay on schedule.<br>



<br>



</span>



We will provide source code solutions to all labs. The TA will grade your solutions and write up a grade sheet
on the correctness, simplicity, and clarity of your code. The
instructor will review the TA's grading and grade sheets. Your grade
and grade sheet and our source code solution will be mailed to you one week after the lab assignment
is turned in. If you have questions about the grade or grade sheet
please talk to the TA first. If you are still have concerns see the
instructor. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Please do not distribute the source code solutions we provide you with (see honor code).</span><br>






















<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>



<span style="font-weight: bold;">20% - Team project</span></span><br>






















<br>






















The project is made up of a small team (approx four people)
and&nbsp;requires strong collaboration and a problem solving mindset to
get the job done. The instructor will put the teams together with each
member being responsible to deliver against a part of the overal system
design, implementation, testing and integration.&nbsp; The goals of
this activity are to help you develop the confidence, skills, and
habits necessary to write large computer programs while part of a
multi-person team. You will become conversant in software engineering
paradigms, and be exposed to various public-domain and open source
tools that make the software development process easier. In addition,
you will develop vital skills in self-directed learning, problem
solving, and communication. The project will have a design and code
review as well as the demo. A project report that captures the design
and implementation will be submitted as part of the assesment.<br>





















<h2><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Policy for Late Assignments</span></h2>





















Unless prior arrangements have been made, or in case of medical or
family emergencies, or specific disabilities, all assignments are
subject to the following policy regarding late submissions:<br>





















<br>





















Programming assignments&nbsp;must be submitted according to the schedule; if late, the following grade penalties are assessed:<br>





















<br>





















Late &lt; 8 hours<br>





















&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten percent (10%) will be deducted from the final score.<br>





















Late &ge; 8 hours and &lt; 24 hours<br>





















&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twenty percent (20%) will be deducted from the final score.<br>





















Late &ge; 24 hours and &lt; 48 hours<br>





















&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forty percent (40%) will be deducted from the final score.<br>





















Late 48 or more hours<br>





















&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak to the lecturer.<br>












<br>










Caveat:
This course is still under development in terms of the programming
assignment so while the grade penalties seem set in stone they are<br>










not.
Please talk to me if you are running behind. The most important thing
for you to do is&nbsp;to finish the programming assignments and not worry<br>










about being late.<br>





















<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"></span><br>








In that spirit: &nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Two free pass for 48 hour extension with no penalty</span>. You really don't want to use these because they mean you are behind and<br>








need to catch up. But they are there if you need then - pressure value of sorts.<br>








<h2><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Lab Access</span></h2>

























<span style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">In
order to obtain access to Sudikoff after hours, and to get into
Sudikoff's Lab 001, you will need to have your Dartmouth ID card
activated for the appropriate access.
To do this, stop by and see Kelly at 101 Sudikoff on a weekday between
8:30am-12:00pm, or 1:00-4:00pm, and bring your Dartmouth ID card.
Inform Kelly that you are taking CS23, and require access to Lab 001.
You will have to fill out and sign a form stating that you understand
the various policies about access to the labs in Sudikoff.</span><br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">

























<br style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">

























<span style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Keep in mind that it may take 24 hours for access to be activated, so please plan ahead!</span><br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">

























<br style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">

























<span style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">You
will also require a computer account on the CS Linux machines. Contact
Andrew Campbell, via email, informing him of your preferred (new)
account name.</span><br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">

























<br style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">

























<span style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Please
note that the exterior doors of Sudikoff are automatically locked after
6:00pm weekdays, and also every weekend and holiday. In addition, the
laboratory doors are locked at all times. You will need your access
card to pass through locked doors.</span><br>

<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

























<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Not requireed
but if I where to recommend a hands on book on Linux and shell
programming&nbsp; it would be this one (lots of good stuff in this):</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>










</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Just to make things clear. Buy the Computer Network book for the course. But if
you are interested in hacking C, shell scripts, Linux you might like
the other books for your library. They are all really nice books - I love them.</span></span><br>










<h2><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Policy on Joint Work and the Dartmouth Honor Code</span></h2>
















<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">The assignments and project are all about writing great code - shell scripts and C. Here is the policy for joint work in CS23:</span><br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
















<br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
















<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">First, you may
discuss and help each other (e.g., help in debugging, sharing
knowledge, giving moral support, getting coffee, etc.) - I promote that
as the type of team spirit and joint problem solving skills that is the
essense of the course and necessary to do a great project. However -
there if always a however or but, right, - you cannot work jointly on
coding up (i.e., writing) your programming assignments. You can talk,
discuss solutions, even show snippets of code on the white board (not
the computer) to solve a problem but you cannot jointly work on
the&nbsp;code development and writing. Submitted code for the labs has
to be yours and yours alone. </span><br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
















<br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
















<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">The project
phase is different. You can work jointly on writing code. But you
cannot take code from anywhere (e.g., the web or any other source). It
has to be the joint product of the team. One caveat: no sharing of code
between teams. As above, teams can discuss code, show each other
snippets on the white board, but not share source code. The project
phase of the course is a friendly competition so there isn't a lot of
incentive to share code.</span><br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
















<br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
















<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">We hate to state
this since you all know it but it is necessary to be explicit here
(citation - culled and extended from CS8 Policy on joint work):</span><br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
















<br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
















<table style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" width="100%">

















  <tbody>
















    <tr>
















      <td><span style="color: rgb(0, 51, 0);">You would be amazed at
how easy it is to tell when people work together
on problem sets, particularly coding exercises. Think about the simple
shell
commands we can run against your source code from labs and projects,
or, the shell script we can use to compare your lab assignments and
projects against every other assignment and project ever submitted to
us - it would take less that a millisecond to run these checks - no
effort on our behalf. Similarly, we know how to use google too. You
should not under any circumstance look at or use code from previous
terms' CS23 assignments and projects. Our scripts are smarter than
that. The message is - please don't make life unpleasant for all of us
by breaking these rules. The penalties for cheating at Dartmouth are
severe, starting with suspension and including expulsion. If you are
unsure about anything, please ask</span>.</td>

<br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
















<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">We take the
Honor Code very seriously, so please, if you are unclear on any matter
regarding this policy, do not hesitate to see me in office hours, and
we will be more than happy to answer your questions. </span><br>
