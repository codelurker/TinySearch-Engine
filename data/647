<META NAME="abstract" CONTENT="	  One of the most commonly used graphics protocol is the X
Protocol, enabling programs to display graphics images.  When running
the X Protocol over the network, a lot of structured data (messages
with fields) need to be transmitted.  Delays can be detected by human
users when connected through a low-bandwidth network.  The solution is
to compress the X protocol.  XRemote, a network version of the X
Protocol, uses Dictionary-based compression.  In XRemote, strings are
recorded in the dictionary.  When a string repeats, its index in the
dictionary is transmitted.  Higher Bandwidth X (HBX) uses statistical
modeling techniques instead.  A context model, which depends on the
nature of the field in a particular type of message and the
frequencies of the values of the field, is associated with each field.
XRemote is much faster than HBX, but HBX achieves better compression
than XRemote.  The KLZ system is developed to take advantage of our
knowledge about the fields in the XMotionNotify packet (what X sends
when the mouse moves) and fast Dictionary (LZW) compression.  In
essence, KLZ reorders and rewrites fields in the XMotionNotify packet
so that the fields will be more easily compressed by the fast LZ
coder.  My experiments show that KLZ compresses this packet nearly as
well as HBX, and 5 times better than pure LZ.  KLZ is slightly faster
than pure LZ, and and 10 times faster than HBX.  Since many modems
already implement LZ compression, KLZ could also be used to reorder
data before passing them to the modem with LZ compression for
transmission. This reordering would lead to vastly improved
compression almost for free.">

</P><P>
	  One of the most commonly used graphics protocol is the X
Protocol, enabling programs to display graphics images.  When running
the X Protocol over the network, a lot of structured data (messages
with fields) need to be transmitted.  Delays can be detected by human
users when connected through a low-bandwidth network.  The solution is
to compress the X protocol.  XRemote, a network version of the X
Protocol, uses Dictionary-based compression.  In XRemote, strings are
recorded in the dictionary.  When a string repeats, its index in the
dictionary is transmitted.  Higher Bandwidth X (HBX) uses statistical
modeling techniques instead.  A context model, which depends on the
nature of the field in a particular type of message and the
frequencies of the values of the field, is associated with each field.
XRemote is much faster than HBX, but HBX achieves better compression
than XRemote.  The KLZ system is developed to take advantage of our
knowledge about the fields in the XMotionNotify packet (what X sends
when the mouse moves) and fast Dictionary (LZW) compression.  In
essence, KLZ reorders and rewrites fields in the XMotionNotify packet
so that the fields will be more easily compressed by the fast LZ
coder.  My experiments show that KLZ compresses this packet nearly as
well as HBX, and 5 times better than pure LZ.  KLZ is slightly faster
than pure LZ, and and 10 times faster than HBX.  Since many modems
already implement LZ compression, KLZ could also be used to reorder
data before passing them to the modem with LZ compression for
transmission. This reordering would lead to vastly improved
compression almost for free.
