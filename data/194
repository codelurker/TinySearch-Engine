<h2>Course Description</h2>

<p>Commercial mobile devices with embedded sensors are becoming
increasingly popular. There are already several examples of mobile
applications that utilize and share information generated by a
community of users (e.g., Whrrl, Loopt, Cenceme). The goal of this
project-oriented seminar is to first understand the specific challenges
of community sensing and then to build a community-based system that
harnesses sensor data collected by multiple devices. We will primarily
focus on developing: (i) systems and networking techniques to support
community-sensing and (ii) machine-learning techniques to learn the
behavior and context of the user both individually and collectively.
<br />

</p>

<p>Students will be required to develop on the iPhone and/or the
Mobile
Sensing Platform (a custom wearable sensing
platform). These platforms will be used to collect sensor data as a
group all throughout the quarter. Because this is not a programming
course students will need to be
motivated to quickly gain sufficient iPhone programming expertise
mostly through self study.&nbsp;
The first part of the seminar will involve reading and presenting
research papers and brainstorming (Tuesday
session), as well as gaining programing experience
through a series of iPhone/MSP programming assignments, and learning
necessary machine learning concepts (Thursday session).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The focus of the second half of the seminar will be on
developing cooperative techniques for sensing and modeling that would
lead to more efficient data collection, more accurate
inference, and richer applications for mobile systems. The
project phase will require a substantial amount of programming,
collection
and analysis of sensor data, therefore, require a significant time
commitment on the
part of students. In essence, we plan
to delve into this new field and discover new research problems and
techniques to solve these problems. We plan to quickly come up with a
holistic project that combines
distributed sensing and community-based statistical reasoning
techniques and results in a compelling application.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Honor Code</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify;">We encourage you to
discuss papers and project ideas with your classmates. You are
permitted
to use available SDKs and machine learning toolboxes for your project
but you
need to explicitly reference the resources you use. Your project needs
to include significant coding and/or experimental design beyond the use
of available toolboxes. You must reference all other sources of help
and collaboration.<br />
