<h1> Ph.D. Admissions</h1>


<h2 class="break"> Admission Requirements </h2>

<p>
  Application to the PhD program for Fall 2008 must be
  completed <href="https://app.applyyourself.com/?id=dart-grad">
  online</a>.  The deadline for submission of all application
  materials is
<STRONG>January 9, 2009</STRONG>.

<P>The required components of your application are:
  
  <OL CLASS="req">
    <LI> <a href="https://app.applyyourself.com/?id=dart-grad">The
    online application form</a>
    <LI>Three (3) letters of recommendation
    <LI>College transcripts
    <LI>GRE scores (photocopy accepted, original required upon
      admission)
    <LI>
      TOEFL or IELTS scores (required for
      non-native English speakers,
      photocopy accepted, original
      required upon admission)
    <LI>The $30 application fee
  </OL>
  
<P>
  These items must reach us by January 9, 2009 in order for your
  application to receive full consideration.
<P>
  Arrange for official transcripts to be sent to us from each college
  or university you have attended as a regular undergraduate or
  graduate student. They must arrive by January 9, 2009.
<P>
We require the General GRE. Your score report must reach us by January
9, 2009. If it will be late, you may send us a photocopy now and the
official report later. We do not require the Subject GRE. However, if
you do not have an academic degree in Computer Science, we recommend
the subject GRE in Computer Science, since it demonstrates a certain
level of preparation in the field. 
<P>
If English is not your native language, we require that you take the
TOEFL (Test Of English as a Foreign Language) or the IELTS
(International English Language Testing System exam). An IELTS band
score of 7.0 or above is required for Dartmouth Programs, but we have
no specific test score requirements for the TOEFL or GRE. If you are
transferring from a U.S. university, we may waive the language test.
As with the GRE, we will accept a photocopy until the official report
is available, but the photocopy must reach us by January 9, 2009.
<P>
We prefer that your recommenders give their recommendations
online. Once you have listed their names on the application, an email
will be sent to them with a link to the application site. However, if
necessary, we will accept recommendations in sealed envelopes through
the mail.
<P>
We require a $30.00 application fee, to be paid by credit card
online. The fee helps to cover the cost of processing your application
and is non-refundable. The application fee will not be waived. 
<P>
Like many graduate programs, we base our admissions decisions
primarily on the information requested above. We have no minimum test
scores. We recognize that you may have talents and experience that do
not shine through the forms and test scores.
<P> 
Use the <em>Application Essay</em> section of the online application to give
additional information. Do you have a specific reason for coming to
Dartmouth? Specific goals for your study? Significant work experience?
Why do you want to do advanced training in computer science? Include
any publications you have authored 
<P>
In the <em>Computer Science Supplement</em> section of the online application,
attach examples of your work. This is also the place where you can
attach a resume.
<P>
At the discretion of the admissions committee, we award stipends as
well as tuition grants without stipend. The stipend awards cover
tuition waiver and a payment for living expenses for nine months of
each year for five years, as long as satisfactory progress is made
toward the Ph.D. The stipend for 2009-2010 will be set in early 2009
(the stipend for 2008-2009 is $1,947 per month). Full-time students
pay only $160 toward their $1,654 health insurance cost for the
year. Graduate students who receive support contribute to the program
by teaching or grading undergraduate courses, assisting with advanced
courses, and participating in research projects. Additional stipend is
provided for the summer months if the student performs research or
teaching assistance during that period.
<P>
There is no separate application for financial aid. Every applicant is
considered for financial aid, unless you say that you do not need
financial support. If you do not need support, please indicate this on
the application form, and tell us how you expect to be supported.
