approximation scheme for the problem when the number of leaves in the
tree graph is at most poly-logarithmic in $n$ (the number of demands),

<b>Abstract:</b>
</P><P>
   We consider the approximability of the Unsplittable Flow Problem
(UFP) on tree graphs, and give a deterministic quasi-polynomial time
approximation scheme for the problem when the number of leaves in the
tree graph is at most poly-logarithmic in $n$ (the number of demands),
and when all edge capacities and resource requirements are suitably
bounded.
Our algorithm generalizes a recent technique that obtained the first
such approximation scheme for line graphs.  Our results show that the
problem is not APX-hard for such graphs unless NP \subseteq
DTIME(2^{polylog(n)}).  Further, a reduction from the
Demand Matching Problem shows that UFP is APX-hard when the number of
leaves is Omega(n^\epsilon) for any constant \epsilon > 0.
</P><P>
   Together, the two results give a nearly tight characterization of the
approximability of the problem on tree graphs in terms of the number
of leaves, and show the structure of the graph that results in
hardness of approximation.
