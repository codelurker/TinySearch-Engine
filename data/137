<h2>Format of the numbers</h2>

When we began our technical-report series in 1986, we chose to number
them with the format PCS-TRyy-nnn, where yy was the 2-digit year
(19yy), and nnn was a sequence number.  Needless to say this led to a
Y2K problem.<p>

As of the year 2000, when new reports are added, they will be numbered
differently: TRyyyy-nnn.  The old pre-2000 reports will still be
numbered PCS-TRyy-nnn, that is, no old reports will change their
numbers.  The sequence number nnn will still be consecutive across the
change to the new format; thus the last TR of the second millenium is
PCS-TR99-261, and the first TR of the third millenium will be number
TR2000-362.<p>

For those who like details, in the old format the first three letters
could actually be one of three possibilities:
<ul>
  <li> "PCS": a paper in computer science
  <li> "DCS": a diskette in computer science
  <li> "TCS": a tape in computer science
</ul>
There are only a few DCS or TCS reports
(see <a href="abstracts/1986.shtml">1986</a>).
I believe the "CS" initials were added because, at the time, we were
part of a "Department of Math and Computer Science" and there may have
been an intention to have "PMA", "DMA", and "TMA" (Math) technical
reports as well.
