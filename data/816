<META NAME="abstract" CONTENT=" This thesis addresses vulnerabilities in current Trusted Computing
architecture by exploring a design for a better Trusted Platform
Module (TPM); one that integrates more closely with the CPU's Memory
Management Unit (MMU). We establish that software-based attacks on
trusted memory can be carried out undetectably by an adversary on
current TCG/TPM implementations. We demonstrate that an attacker with
sufficient privileges can compromise the integrity of a TPM-protected
system by modifying critical loaded code and static data after
measurement has taken place. More specifically, these attacks
illustrate the Time Of Check vs. Time of Use (TOCTOU) class of
attacks.

 We propose to enhance the MMU, enabling it to detect when memory
containing trusted code or data is being maliciously modified at
run-time. On detection, it should be able to notify the TPM of these
modifications. We seek to use the concepts of selective memory
immutability as a security tool to harden the MMU, which will result
in a more robust TCG/TPM implementation. To substantiate our ideas for
this proposed hardware feature, we designed and implemented a software
prototype system, which employs the monitoring capabilities of the Xen
virtual machine monitor.

 We performed a security evaluation of our prototype and validated
that it can detect all our software-based TOCTOU attacks. We applied
our prototype to verify the integrity of data associated with an
application, as well as suggested and implemented ways to prevent
unauthorized use of data by associating it with its owner process. Our
performance evaluation reveals minimal overhead.

 This thesis addresses vulnerabilities in current Trusted Computing
architecture by exploring a design for a better Trusted Platform
Module (TPM); one that integrates more closely with the CPU's Memory
Management Unit (MMU). We establish that software-based attacks on
trusted memory can be carried out undetectably by an adversary on
current TCG/TPM implementations. We demonstrate that an attacker with
sufficient privileges can compromise the integrity of a TPM-protected
system by modifying critical loaded code and static data after
measurement has taken place. More specifically, these attacks
illustrate the Time Of Check vs. Time of Use (TOCTOU) class of
attacks.

 We propose to enhance the MMU, enabling it to detect when memory
containing trusted code or data is being maliciously modified at
run-time. On detection, it should be able to notify the TPM of these
modifications. We seek to use the concepts of selective memory
immutability as a security tool to harden the MMU, which will result
in a more robust TCG/TPM implementation. To substantiate our ideas for
this proposed hardware feature, we designed and implemented a software
prototype system, which employs the monitoring capabilities of the Xen
