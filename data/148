<h3 id="nsf">NSF Graduate Research Fellowships</h3>

<strong>Deadline</strong>: November 4, 1999.

<p>
Three-year graduate fellowships in science, mathematics, and
engineering.
</p>

<p>
Applicants must be US citizens or nationals, or permanent resident
aliens of the US.  Eligible applicants are college seniors, first-year
graduate students, and "others who have completed a limited amount of

means).
</p>

<p>
There are additional awards offered for "Women in Engineering and
Computer and Information Science".
</p>

<p>
Awards made in March 2000 will carry a stipend for each fellow of
$15,000 for a 12-month tenure (prorated monthly at $1,250 for lesser
periods) and an annual cost-of-education allowance of $10,500, paid to
the fellow's institution in lieu of tuition and fees.
</p>

<h3 id="DoD">The Department of Defense National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship Program</h3>

<strong>Deadline</strong>: January 19, 2000

<p>

Three-year fellowships in science or engineering.  The three years
must be consecutive (with certain exceptions).

</p><p>

Applicants must be US citizens or nationals.  Permanent residents are
<em>not</em> eligible.  NDSEG Fellowships are intended for students at
or near the beginning of their graduate studies in science or
engineering.  Ninety percent of the fellowships in 1998 were awarded
to students who had not yet started their second year of graduate
school.  Applicants must receive or be on track to receive their
baccalaureate degrees by Fall 2000.  Applications are encouraged from
women, persons with disabilities and minorities, including members of
ethnic minority groups such as American Indian, Black, Hispanic,
Native Alaskan (Eskimo or Aleut) or Pacific Islander (Polynesian or
Micronesian).

</p><p>

Current award is a 12-month stipend of $18,500 for 2000-2001, $19,500
for 2001-2002, and $20,500 for 2002-2003, plus full tuition and
required fees.

</p><p>

NDSEG Fellows do not incur any military or other service obligation.

</p><p>

</p>

<h3 id="Hertz">Fannie and John Hertz Foundation Fellowship Awards</h3>

<strong>Deadline</strong>: November 5, 1999

<p>

Current award is a 9-month stipend of $25,000, renewable for up to 5
years, plus a cost-of-education allowance, which pays tuition and
fees.  The hitch is that you must be enrolled at one of their "tenable
institutions", which include most of the top CS graduate programs.

</p><p>

Eligible applicants must be students of the applied physical sciences
who are citizens or permanent residents of the United States of
America, and who are "willing to morally commit to make their skills
available to the United States in times of national emergency" (sounds
risky, but there's actually no legally binding commitment
here). College seniors wishing to pursue the Ph.D. degree in any of
the acceptable fields, as well as graduate students already in the
process of doing so, may apply.  High scholastic performance is
expected, including at least a 3.75/4.00 grade point average during
the last two years of undergraduate work.  Applications from students
with lower GPAs will be reviewed for evidence of unusual ability,
creativity, or accomplishment.

</p><p>

</li></ul>



<h3 id="att">AT&amp;T Labs Fellowship Program</h3>

<strong>Deadline</strong>: January 15, 2000

<p>

The fellowship provides
</p><ul>
  <li> All educational expenses during the school year, including
       tuition, books, fees, and approved travel expenses.

  </li><li> Education expenses for summer study or university research.

  </li><li> A stipend for living expenses (currently $1,400 per month, paid
       for 12 months the first two years, and 10 months in the ensuing
       years).

  </li><li> Support for attending approved scientific conferences.

  </li><li> A mentor who is a staff member at AT&amp;T Labs.


</li></ul>

<p>

Fellowships are available to outstanding minority and women students
who are pursuing PhD studies in computer and communications-related
fields.

</p><p>

For further information, visit the web page at <a href="http://www.research.att.com/academic/alfp.html">http://www.research.att.com/academic/alfp.html</a>
or write to AT&amp;T Labs Fellowship Administrator, Room C103, 180 Park
Ave., Florham Park, NJ 07932-0971.

</p>


<h3 id="npsc">National Physical Science Consortium (NPSC)
Graduate Fellowships for Minorities and Women in the Physical
Sciences</h3>

<strong>Deadline:</strong> November 5, 1999

<p>

The fellowship is renewable for 6 years.  It provides a yearly stipend
of $12,500 for years 1-4, and $15,000 for years 5-6.  The "NPSC member
university" pays tuition and fees.  The fellowship also provides for
two summers of paid research experience employment.

</p><p>

NPSC welcomes applications from all qualified students with continued
emphasis toward the recruitment of underrepresented minorities:
African American; Hispanic; Native American Indian, Eskimo, Aleut;
Pacific Islander (Polynesian); and/or female.  Must be a U.S. citizen
and have the ability to pursue graduate work at an NPSC member
institution.  Must be an undergraduate senior with at least a 3.0 GPA,
or possess a degree and have been out of school at least one year.
Selection is based on research experience, letters of recommendation,
academic standing, and GRE scores.

</p><p>

<h3 id="belllabs">Lucent Technologies/Bell Laboratories Fellowships</h3>

<strong>Deadline:</strong> January 30, 1999

<p>

Bell Labs sponsors two types of fellowships:
</p><ul>
  <li> Cooperative Research Fellowship Program.  The objective of the
       CRFP is to develop scientific and engineering ability among
       members of those minority groups underrepresented in science.
       The fellowship provides tuition, university fees, books, an
       annual living stipend of $17,000, and related travel
       expenses. Fellowship recipients are eligible for summer
       employment and are matched with a Bell Laboratories scientist
       as a mentor.

  </li><li> Graduate Research Program for Women.  GRPW is designed to
       identify and develop scientific and engineering ability in
       women and to increase the representation of women in these
       fields.  The fellowship provides an annual living stipend of
       $17,000, tuition and fees, and textbook allowance.
