We present new forensic tools that are capable of detecting traces of
tampering in digital images without the use of watermarks or
specialized hardware. These tools operate under the assumption that
images contain natural properties from a variety of sources, including
the world, the lens, and the sensor. These properties may be disturbed
by digital tampering and by measuring them we can expose the
forgery. In this context, we present the following forensic tools: (1)
illuminant direction, (2) specularity, (3) lighting environment, and
(4) chromatic aberration. The common theme of these tools is that they
exploit lighting or optical properties of images. Although each tool
is not applicable to every image, they add to a growing set of image
forensic tools that together will complicate the process of making a
convincing forgery.
