<P>
<I>
Photography lost its innocence many years ago.  In as early as the
1860s, photographs were already being manipulated, only a few decades
after Niepce created the first photograph in 1814.  With the advent of
high-resolution digital cameras, powerful personal computers and
sophisticated photo-editing software, the manipulation of digital
images is becoming more common.  Here, I have collected some examples
of tampering throughout history.

<p>

To help contend with the implications of this tampering, we have
developed a series of tools for <A HREF="../tampering.html">detecting
traces of tampering</A> in digital images (contact me at <a
href=http://hanyfarid.org/maat>Ma'at Consulting</a> for more

Abraham Lincoln is a composite of Lincoln's head and the Southern

the date of this image into context, note that the first permanent
photographic image was created in 1826 and the Eastman Dry Plate
Company (later to become Eastman Kodak) was created in 1881. </TD>

no longer use that technology to manipulate elements in a photo simply

1990, 2.5% of allegations examined by the <A

of doctoring photos to distort her makeup as a way to poke fun at her.
Harris became famous when she oversaw the Florida recount in the 2000
presidential election, that gave George W. Bush a 537-vote victory in
Florida.  "I'm actually very sensitive about those things, and it's
personally painful," she said. "But they're outrageously
false. ... Whenever they made fun of my makeup, it was because the
newspapers colorized my photograph."  Harris and her staff have not,
however, been able to cite a specific example of an altered photo.
The photo of Harris, shown here, is not known to have been doctored.

from an automatic speed camera had not been doctored.  This case
revolved around the integrity of MD5, a digital signature algorithm,
intended to prove that pictures have not been doctored after their

This photo, taken of U.S. President George W. Bush as he sat in a

a note to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice reading, "I think I may
need a bathroom break. Is this possible?"  Reuters' picture editor,
Gary Hershorn, explained that sections of the photo were overexposed
so a Reuters' processor used the Photoshop technique to "burn down the
note."  Hershorn says that the photo was not manipulated in any way,
but that it was standard practice for such news photos to be enhanced.

shirt and tie worn by Mark Warner, the former Virginia governor who is
a possible candidate for the presidency. The jacket was charcoal, not
maroon; the shirt was light blue, not pink; the tie was dark blue with
stripes, not maroon.  The Times's policy rules out alteration of
photographs that depict actual news scenes and, even in a contrived
illustration, requires acknowledgment in a credit. In this case, the
film that was used can cause colors to shift, and the processing
altered them further; the change escaped notice because of a

An Easton, Middlesbrough (UK) man, Stafford Sven Tudor-Miles, scanned
photographs of adult porn stars into his computer and digitally
altered them so that the women appeared to be of girls under the age of
18.  The 38-year-old fine art student was charged with possessing
indecent pseudo-images of children.  His barrister argued that the
pictures were of adults and, therefore, no offense had been committed.
Under the Protection of Children Act 1978, as amended by the Criminal
Justice and Public Order Act 1994, a pseudophotograph of a child is
defined as an image, whether made by computer graphics or otherwise,
which appears to be that of a child.  Possession or creation of such an
image is, therefore, illegal.  Tudor-Miles pleaded guilty to five
counts of attempting to make indecent pseudo-photographs of children,
one charge of possessing indecent pseudo-photographs and one of
breaching a sex offenders order.  Tudor-Miles will be sentenced on
September 8.

<B> May 2007:</B> The biceps of tennis player Andy Roddick were
conspicuously enlarged on the cover of Men's Fitness magazine.
Roddick commented that he was "pretty sure I'm not as fit as the Men's
Fitness cover suggests".  He also noted that a prominent birthmark on
his right arm had been erased.  Richard Valvo, a spokesman for Men's
Fitness, said, "We wouldn't comment on any type of production issue."
Adding, "I don't see what the big issue is here."</TD>

<P>
<B> July 2007:</B> Missouri University professor R. Michael Roberts
and co-authors retracted their paper (Cdx2 Gene Expression and
Trophectoderm Lineage Specification in Mouse Embryos) published in
<i>Science</i> after an investigation revealed that accompanying
images were doctored.  Contrary to conventional wisdom, the published
research presented evidence that the first two cells of mouse embryos
possess markers that indicate from a very early stage whether they
will grow into a fetus or placenta.  An investigating university
committee found that lead author and post-doctoral researcher Kaushik
Deb deliberately altered images of the embryos.  Deb abruptly resigned
his position and moved with no forwarding address or explanation.  The
committee said Roberts was cleared of wrongdoing by the committee, but
that there was some concern over "whether he had acted appropriately
at all times" during the research period. "Since he addressed that in
the letter he sent to <i>Science</i>, we had no reason to suspect
anything other than that he had been tricked."</TD>

take a photograph of Mr Purnell in the same spot very shortly after
and merge it with the earlier photograph, to which Mr. Purnell kindly
consented."  A Purnell spokeswoman denied that he agreed to the

photographs of the President and other high-ranking officials who have
dedicated their lives to public service, in a taxpayer-funded building
frequented by schoolchildren and the general public," said Matthew

critical of Corzine's financial restructuring plans.  In a letter to

that are nothing more than editorial cartoons morphed into photographs
are fine -- for the editorial page. But placement of such images on
the front page of the Sunday edition demonstrates a disregard for
objective reporting."  The <i>Press's</i> executive editor said that
the photo did not blur the line between news reporting and editorial
commentary.  "That wasn't what we were trying to do," he said. "We
were just trying to frame the story for readers. We were doing it in a
way that was a little edgy, and in a way that would grab your
