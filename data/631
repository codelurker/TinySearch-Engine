<b>Abstract:</b>
</P><P>
	I have developed, tested, and evaluated a robot programming
environment organized as a library of flexible data structures to
facilitate the creation of robotics programs.  Abstractions are the
basis of all of the achievements of Computer Science, and if it were
possible to create a truly flexible, generic abstraction for the
programming of robots -- the science of robotics could advance at a
faster pace.  For this reason, I have attempted to implement the
abstraction of low-level commands, and the assembling of them into
hierarchies of higher-level actions. My libraries provide mechanisms
for the manipulation and queuing of actions, as well as for the timing
of low-level sensing and actuation.  I have tested these libraries by
implementing a cooperative multi-agent formation algorithm in the
SoccerServer environment.  Often, when a new level of abstraction is
introduced -- significant overhead is added.  However, I have
conducted experiments to show that there is no significant overhead in
using this system by comparing the performance of SoccerServer agents
that have been programmed using it against the performance of other
agents.
