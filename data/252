<h1><a href="..">David Kotz</a>: Hiking and skiing</h1>

I like to hike and ski, especially in the <a href="http://hikethewhites.com/">White Mountains of New
Hampshire</a>, especially with my <a href="../kids/">kids</a>.
<p>

On August 24, 1996, I finally finished hiking <a
href="http://hikethewhites.com/summits_alf.html">all 48</a> of the peaks over 4000' in
the <a href="http://hikethewhites.com/">Whites</a>, on <a
href="http://hikethewhites.com/wildcat.html">Wildcat&nbsp;A</a>.
