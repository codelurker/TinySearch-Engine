<b>Abstract:</b>
</P><P>
 One of the major drawbacks in the field of computer software
development has been the inability for applications to compile once
and execute across many different platforms.  With the emergence of
the Internet and the networking of many different platforms, the Java
programming language and the Java Platform was created by Sun
Microsystems to address this "Write Once, Run Anywhere" problem.  What
sets a compiled Java program apart from programs compiled from other
high level languages is the ability of a Java Virtual Machine to
execute the compiled Java program on any platform, as long as the Java
Virtual Machine is running on top of that platform.
</P><P>
 Java's cross platform capabilities can be extended to other high
level languages such as C.  The main objective of our project is to
implement a compiler targeting the Java Platform for a subset of the C
language.  This will allow code written in that subset of C to be
compiled into Java Virtual Machine instructions, also known as JVM
bytecode, which can then be executed on a Java Virtual Machine running
on any platform.

 The reader is assumed to be intimately familiar with compiler
construction, the use of the flex scanner generator, the use of the
GNU bison parser generator, and the structure and implementation of
the Java Virtual Machine.
