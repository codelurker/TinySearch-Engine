At Dartmouth, Computer Science majors are some of the most interesting
people you will meet.
<br>Here are profiles of some of our majors,
including what they think of Computer Science at Dartmouth and what
their other interests are.

			<p>
				<b>Reason for being a CS major: </b>
				I originally thought that I wanted to be an engineering major.  But being a CS major allowed me to have a much more broad education.  I modified with economics, another one of my interests, while taking several EE courses over at Thayer.</p>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Best thing about being a CS major: </b>
				You are allowed to "not just be a CS" major.  My brother is in the EECS program at Berkeley 	and he only gets 7 electives total.  Not so here at Dartmouth; you get your technical experience, while being able to improve your writing and thinking skills, giving you an advantage over other CS programs. <p>

		<br><h3>Fred Ware</h3>
		Los Altos Hills, California
		</td>
		<td width="40%">
			<b> Non-CS interests: </b> I'm a three-time all Ivy kicker on the
			Dartmouth football team.  I also write cartoons for the Dartmouth D
			and the Review.  This shows that you don't have to "just be a CS
			major" and you have time to do other things. <p>

			<b> Future plans: </b> I'm going to be working at Rambus in the
			Silicon Valley next year.  They make RDRAM, one of the main kinds of
			RAM.  I will also be taking MSEE courses at Stanford next year part
			time. <p>

			<b>Advice to incoming students: </b> CS 5 can be a lot of work; make
			sure you take with a somewhat light load.  You will enjoy it a lot
			more if you can concentrate on it, and not your other courses. <p>

	<tr>
		<td width="40%">
			<b> Reason for being a CS major: </b>
			I took a couple of introductory CS classes, and found that I
			enjoyed them more than my other classes. It was an area I
			knew very little about, which meant that it was interesting
			to learn about it. <p>
			<b> Other major/minor: </b> I modified the CS major with Engineering,
			so that I would have some experience with hardware as well as
			software. <p>

			<b> Best thing about being a CS major: </b> Getting to do interesting
			projects. Most upper-level classes involve some kind of
			project. They're usually enjoyable and always challenging. <p>

			<b> Worst thing about being a CS major: </b> Those projects take up a
			lot of time. CS may be one of the most difficult majors, in terms of
			the workload. </p>

		<br><img src="images/Torrey.JPG" border="1">
		<br><h3>Lisa Torrey</h3>
		Cheshire, Connecticut
		</td>
		<td width="40%">
			<b> Favorite CS class: </b> My favorite material, I think, was in CS
			49 (Theory of Computation). It's one of those classes whose
			description sounds very dry when you don't understand it at all, but
			once you start to learn it, the concepts are very cool: how problems
			fit into classes, how machine models have been designed for each
			class, how there are provable limits to what we can actually compute,
			etc. <p>

			<b> Non-CS interests: </b> Some interests are hiking, dance,
			instrumental music, science fiction & fantasy, foreign languages, and
			most recently, sewing medieval costumes. <p>

			<b> Future plans: </b> I'm going to grad school at the University of
			Wisconsin for CS.  After that, who knows? <p>

			<b> If I could do it all over again: </b> I would still choose a CS
			major. I wouldn't modify it with engineering, though--I would take
			more math instead. <p>

<table width="100%" align="center" class="thin2">
	<tr>
		<td width="40%">
			<b> Reason for being a CS major: </b> When I took CS 5 on a whim
			freshman fall, I discovered this entire new discipline that I've never
			heard about before.  And it was a very exciting experience.  After
			doing CS 18 I took a few terms away from CS and explored other
			departments, but none of the courses were as exciting for me.  I guess
			I chose CS because I've been working with computers on the
			"functionality" level for quite some time, and would like to get
			deeper into the "how" and the "why." <p>

			<b> Favorite CS class: </b> Operating systems (CS 58), because that was
			probably the most I've learned in a course, plus we got to build a
			kernel, even if it was just a really small one; the hands-on
			experience was a huge plus. <p>

			<b> Best thing about being a CS major: </b> Being able to take classes
			in all of the other departments as well (although this is true for
			liberal arts schools in general).  Being able to work very closely
			with the faculty, and allowing undergrads to TA courses, that was
			definitely a worthwhile experience. <p>

		<td align="center" width="20%">
		<br><img src="images/Wang.JPG" border="1">
		<br><h3>Jerry Wang</h3>
		Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada
		</td>
		<td width="40%">
			<b> Worst thing about being a CS major: </b> The long nights at
			Sudikoff.  At least there are windows in 005.  More specific though,
			it's the short terms that gets to me sometimes.  While I enjoy the
			fast pace of a 10-week term, more often than not it really takes a
			toll by the end of the term, and especially with courses that cover a
			lot of material sometimes it's tough to internalize everything in such
			a short period of time. <p>

			<b> Advice to incoming students: </b> Approach it with an open mind.
			Try it out and see if it's for you, even if you don't think so.  You
			won't know until you try.  And if you're worried about getting a bad
			grade, there's always the NRO (I wished I was told about NROs much
			earlier than I did), and plenty of help around the department.  Always
			talk to people, always ask questions.  Don't try to figure stuff out
			on your own.  It's <em>so</em> much easier with guidance. <p>

<table width="100%" align="center" class="thin2">
	<tr>
		<td width="40%">
			<b> Favorite CS class: </b> My favorite classes are CS 18 and 21.  The
			teaching (Drysdale) was fantastic, and the classes taught me a lot
			about the theoretical parts of computer science.  Homework was
			problem-oriented, and I felt really cool when I was able to solve the
			problems.  The classes were a lot of work, but at the end, I felt like
			they were worth it. <p>

			<b> Best thing about being a CS major: </b> Time commitment.  It's a
			lot of hours, but you work hard and gain a lot of confidence in your
			abilities to tackle an big project or a hard problem.  The way I
			approach my other subjects, or any problem for that matter, is with
			the knowledge that I can break the assignment into reasonable parts
			and put the time in to succeed.  The critical thinking skills and the
			ability to hold a complex problem in my head, have prepared me really
			well for business and especially law school.  The LSATs, especially
			the logic games, use a lot of the meta-knowledge that one learns in CS
			at Dartmouth. <p>

		<br><h3>Beau Roysden</h3>
		Phoenix, Arizona
		</td>
		<td width="40%">
			<b> Worst thing about being a CS major: </b> Time commitment.  I've
			had to sacrifice a lot of other activities and not participate in
			other things as much becuase of the time that the major
			requires. Also, I sometimes feel as though my GPA doesn't reflect the
			amount of work I put into my major, when compared to students enrolled
			in other majors.  This is hard to accept when I know I will be
			competing with students of every major to get into law school and to
			get jobs. <p>

			<b> Non-CS interests: </b> Politics.  I ran a statewide campaign in
			Arizona in 2002.  Swimming, I swam for Dartmouth my freshman year. <p>

			<b> Advice to incoming students: </b> Think about why you want to
			study CS or any other major.  What are the larger skills that you will
			pick up (critical thinking, work ethic, etc.) and take with you for
			the rest of your life? <p>

			<b> Favorite CS class: </b> I really enjoyed CS 85 (Distributed

			88 (Building and breaking secure systems) with Smith.  These courses
			are all very different in topic but very interesting for the same

			<b> Reason for being a CS major: </b> The role of technology in

			<b> Other major/minor: </b> I'm an Art History minor. <p>

			<b> Favorite CS class: </b> Probably Theory of Computation (CS 49)
			followed closely by Algorithms (CS 25).  Both of these classes
			emphasized abstract theory and the logical proof. There is something
			about this type of thinking that has always appealed to me.  There is
			something fascinating about the concept of being able to prove or gain

			<b> Worst thing about being a CS major: </b> Anytime after midnight
			that you are still within a computer lab is typically an unhappy
			time. <p>

			<b> Non-CS interests: </b> I'm the editor-in-chief of the Dartmouth
			Jack-O-Lantern humor magazine, produce the JackoTV comedy TV program

			<b> Favorite CS class: </b> CS 49.  I found the content fascinating

			<b> Best thing about being a CS major: </b> We have some great

			<b> If I could do it all over again: </b> I've never regretted

			could not fit them in my schedule because I started late. <p>

			<b> Advice to incoming students: </b> I would say go for it, and do so
			early.  You figure out rather quickly whether you like it, and it's

		<td width="40%">
			<b> Reason for being a CS major: </b> Originally I started with CS as
			a minor primarily due to an interest in graphics as they pertain to
			the film and television industry.  Gradually I began to realize that
			my CS-minor classes were the most challenging, interesting,
			well-taught, and engaging classes I was taking at Dartmouth.  So I
			switched from a Film Studies to a CS major in my junior year. <p>

			<b> Favorite CS class: </b> I really enjoyed Algorithms (CS 25).  I
			seem to prefer the more theoretical side of computer science to
			programming; the union of mathematics, computer science, and
			problem-solving was both fascinating and challenging for me. <p>

			<b> Best thing about being a CS major: </b> The challenge; I have
			always seen Computer Science as structured problem-solving.  It's not
			unlike putting together a jigsaw puzzle, or building a house out of
			legos--it is mathematics with a concrete, absolute answer.  When you
			solve a problem, you know without-a-doubt you've solved it, because
			your program functions correctly.  Thus Computer Science supplied me
			with an endless supply of fun and challenging problems to solve, while
			at the same time offering the satisfaction of creating something
			useful and/or functional. <p>

			<b> Worst thing about being a CS major: </b> The workload can, at
			times, be overwhelming.  There have been particular take-home tests
			and problem sets which proved themselves excruciatingly painful to
			complete. <p>

			<b> Non-CS interests: </b> I sit four-seat in the varsity lightweight
			eight on the lightweight crew team--I've been a member of the squad
			since coming to Dartmouth.  I'm also an active member of Psi Upsilon
			Fraternity.  I've played the violin since I was 10 years old (though
			not actively since attending Dartmouth), and the guitar since I was 6.
			I love watching movies and hope someday to help make them. <p>

			<b> Advice to incoming students: </b> If you don't mind doing the
			work, it can be a challenging, rewarding, and valuable educational
			experience.  Don't let yourself be fooled by the stereotypical image
			of a CS major; what you study need not define who you are, and it is
			not difficult to major in CS while continuing to pursue other
			interests at a very high level. <p>

			<b> Intentions as an incoming student: </b> On arriving I thought I

			hooked and knew that I wanted to study computer science. <p>

			<b> Reason for being a CS major: </b> I have always been interested in

			<b> Other major/minor: </b> I am also majoring in Psychology. <p>

			<b> Favorite CS class: </b> I really enjoyed taking Algorithms (CS
			25).  Though it was challenging, I felt that the level of thought
			involved in understanding and proving algorithms was quite rewarding
			and almost fun at times.  Besides being quite applicable to the
			specific field of computer science, I feel that it gave me insight
			into how to use logic as a tool for supporting an idea and proving

			<b> Best thing about being a CS major: </b> The fact that I can

			like being constructing a skyscraper within the confines of your own
			computer.  Each detail contributes to the whole, and when completed
			the whole can be quite useful and practical to the real world. <p>

			<b> Worst thing about being a CS major: </b> It requires a lot of time
			and effort.  However, in retrospect, this time and effort is well spent
			and quite rewarding.  I guess the thing that I like least about a CS
			course at Dartmouth is the feeling that I get when I take another
			class outside the department, and realize that I could be learning a
			lot more if I were taking a CS course. <p>

			<b> Non-CS interests: </b> I play B-team soccer, am a member of the

			very much.  These topics and their recurrence made me reconsider my
			plan to pursue Math beyond the tertiary level.  I realized that I
			needed a more practical application of Math so I took a few
			introductory classes to programming and really, really enjoyed them.
			By senior year, I was sure that CS was the major that I would want to
			pursue. <p>

			<b> Favorite CS class: </b> I believe the "project class" was my
			favorite class to this point.  It is CS 23, which I took my freshman
			spring.  I really enjoyed the practical aspect of the class, and the
			opportunity it provided to work in a group, building a database that
			interacted with the Internet.  First of all, this was my first
			introduction to UNIX and I liked working with that operating system.
			Secondly, I had an excellent group (we had our ups and downs, but
			overall we worked well together), and by the end we had something that
			worked...well for the most part, that is. <p>

			<b> Best thing about being a CS major: </b> After it all, nothing
			beats the feeling of getting a problem set done or a program to work.
			This is the manifestation of the problem solving of Math with which
			I've always felt fulfilled.  Above all, though I would say it is
			satisfying to know that I am able to participate in, what most
			consider, one of the most difficult fields of study at Dartmouth--I've
			honestly been challenged beyond every expectation in every CS class
			I've taken.  Each term of CS makes me more determined and committed to
			succeeding.  The professors are exceptional teachers and remarkable
			people.  I feel privileged to be a student of such an esteemed
			faculty. <p>

			<b> Other major/minor: </b> I am also majoring in Spanish.  It was
			initially a minor but I went on the FSP to Madrid, and decided to take
			more classes, and eventually filed it as a second major. <p>

			<b> Worst thing about being a CS major: </b> The stress can often
			times be overwhelming.  With such high-paced classes and short terms,
			it is extremely difficult to stay on top of everything which leads to
			much frustration. <p>

			<b> Non-CS interests: </b> Currently, I am the Vice President of the
			04 Class Council.  I am a member of the Organizational Adjudication
			Committee, and the H-Croo chief for the upcoming DOC Freshman Trips.
			I also participate in the Music Ministry of The Aquinas House Catholic
			Center (playing the clarinet), a photographer for the school
			newspaper, The Dartmouth, and an employee for the Jones Media Center
			of Berry Library. <p>

			<b> Advice to incoming students: </b> I would tell them that CS takes
			a lot of dedication, and it will not be easy.  Also, I would tell them
			to ensure that they balance their classes well in order to avoid
			overloading with extremely demanding classes (depending on the
			person's threshold for stress).  Another important piece of advice is
			that they should not allow others to make their decisions for them:
			explore CS, if you are interested in it.  Take CS 5 early and talk to
			your professors about what the major entails, what opportunities are
			available to you through the department, etc.  I came in with a
			preconception that I would be programming for most of my college
			career, but there are a lot of theory classes that are involved, and
			they are necessary for anyone to be a good computer scientist.  I
			believe having a good grasp on the specifics of the major is essential
			to determining whether or not you can dedicate yourself fully to your
			interest of study...CS is no exception. <p>
