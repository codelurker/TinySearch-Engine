<title>Ghana trip</title>

<body>
From Nov 25 to Dec 5, 2001, we visited my cousins John and Mary
Bartholomew in Ho, Ghana.  They
were living in a guest
house of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church.
John was consulting on church matters and teaching at
the seminary at Peki; Mary taught in a girls secondary
school and at the seminary.  They had a wide circle
of friends and acquaintances, developed over 15
years, and use of a car.  We couldn't have had
better tour guides.
<p>
A series of email newsletters from John and
Mary had led us to take the plunge and see this
wonderfully different life.  We were not disappointed.
The region we saw was populous, but not urbanized --
quite distinct from Accra, the capital megalopolis,
and remote from its insecurity.  Copies of three
newsletters that we wrote are available on request.

Some day I'll get around to making
thumbnails of the photos listed below; they
range from 60 to 140KB in size.
