<META NAME="abstract" CONTENT="	Current Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) protocols require 
participating hosts to have fixed IP addresses for the duration of a 
VOIP call.  When using a wireless-enabled host, such as a tablet 
computer on an 802.11 wireless network, it is possible for a 
participant in a VOIP call to roam around the network, moving from 
one subnet to another and needing to change IP addresses.  This 
address change creates the need for mobility support in VOIP 
applications.
	We present the design of Mobile Voice over IP (MVOIP), an 
application-level protocol that enables such mobility in a VOIP 
application based on the ITU H.323 protocol stack.  An MVOIP 
application uses hints from the surrounding network to determine that 
it has switched subnets.  It then initiates a hand-off procedure that 
comprises pausing its current calls, obtaining a valid IP address for 
the current subnet, and reconnecting to the remote party with whom it 
was in a call.  Testing the system shows that on a Windows 2000 
platform there is a perceivable delay in the hand-off process, most 
of which is spent in the Windows API for obtaining DHCP addresses. 
Despite this bottleneck, MVOIP works well on a wireless network.">

<b>Abstract:</b>
</P><P>
	Current Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) protocols require 
participating hosts to have fixed IP addresses for the duration of a 
VOIP call.  When using a wireless-enabled host, such as a tablet 
computer on an 802.11 wireless network, it is possible for a 
participant in a VOIP call to roam around the network, moving from 
one subnet to another and needing to change IP addresses.  This 
address change creates the need for mobility support in VOIP 
applications.
</P><P>
	We present the design of Mobile Voice over IP (MVOIP), an 
application-level protocol that enables such mobility in a VOIP 
application based on the ITU H.323 protocol stack.  An MVOIP 
application uses hints from the surrounding network to determine that 
it has switched subnets.  It then initiates a hand-off procedure that 
comprises pausing its current calls, obtaining a valid IP address for 
the current subnet, and reconnecting to the remote party with whom it 
was in a call.  Testing the system shows that on a Windows 2000 
platform there is a perceivable delay in the hand-off process, most 
of which is spent in the Windows API for obtaining DHCP addresses. 
Despite this bottleneck, MVOIP works well on a wireless network.
