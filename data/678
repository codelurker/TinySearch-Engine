<h3>Announcements</h3>

<h4>What's New <img src = "images/new.gif" alight = left> </h4>

<ul>
<li> (03/17/09) The final has been graded and the grades are online.  Afra will have both the graded finals and Homework Eight in his office.  He will keep them for some time, so if you want to pick them up, drop by.  
</ul>

<h4>What's Old  <img src = "images/old.gif" alight = left> </h4>
<ul>
<li> (03/12/09) The <b>Final</b> is tomorrow, from 8 to 11 AM, in Kemeny 105.  See you all there!
<li> (03/06/09) Last lecture slides are now online.
<li> (03/06/09) Question 2 of hw7 has 8 points, not 9. The perfect score is 76.
<li> (03/06/09) No homework this weekend!  Woohoo!
<li> (03/03/09) Afra has to move his office hours half an hour later to 2:30 &ndash 3:30 PM.  
<li> (03/02/09) Afra's office hours this week will be Tuesday 2 &ndash 3 PM.  
<li> (03/02/09) Xiaoyu's office hour this week is Wednesday 6:00~8:00pm and Thursday 4:00~6:00pm in Sudikoff 110.
<li> (02/27/09) Question 5 (d) in Homework Eight should say <em>directed</em> graph.  Thanks to Eric for pointing this out.  
<li> (02/27/09) The points for Homework Six were as follows:  1 (3), 2 (5), 3 (8), 4 (7), 5 (14), 6 (8), 7 (7), 8 (5), 9 (7), 10 (9), total (73) with X (5). 
<li> (02/27/09) Afra made a mistake in today's lecture:  For sets A and B, 
<ul>
<li> A = B if A is a subset of B and B is a subset of A
<li> A is <em>isomorphic</em> to B if there exists a bijection between them.
</ul>
This means that <em>up to isomorphism</em>, the only interesting thing about a set is its cardinality.  So, Afra had his isomorphism glasses on when he was talking about set equality, which is bad!  Thanks to Jon for pointing this out.
<li> (02/24/09) Afra has to move his Office Hours half an hour later, so it will be from 3:30 PM &ndash; 4:30 PM.  Sorry for the late move!

<li> (02/23/09) Afra's Office Hours will be on Tuesday from 3 &ndash 4 PM.
<li> (02/23/09) Xiaoyu's office hour this week is Wednesday 6:00~8:00pm and Thursday 4:00~6:00pm in Sudikoff 110.
<li> (02/17/09) Skip Problem 9, part (c) on Homework 6.
<li> (02/16/09) Afra's office hours this week is Tuesday 2 &ndash 3 PM in his office.
<li> (02/15/09) Xiaoyu's office hour this week is Wednesday 6:00~8:00pm and Thursday 4:00~6:00pm in Sudikoff 110.
<li> (02/10/09) There are two small mistakes on Homework 5.  On Question 12, in part (a), assume k is a non-zero integer and part (b), ignore the hint.

<li> For question 5c, use a direct proof as described today in class.
</ul>
<li> (01/12/09) Jon pointed out that I made a mistake in discussing <em>Proof by Cases</em>.  The equivalent statement should have <em>and</em>s and not <em>or</em>s between the n different implications.
