      <p class="middle">The term image classification refers to labeling the input 
        images into certain predefined categories and content-based image retrieval 
        has emerged as an important area in computer vision and multimedia computing. 
        The key techniques related to this field contain image representation 
        and classification. In this project I will put my focus on a region-based 
        image representation approach that helps improving the performance of 
        image classification. </p>

        <span class="middle">The objective of my project is to introduce and implement 
        a region-based approach that can better represent the image using low-level 
        features and applying this method in image classification. </span></p>
      <p><span class="middle">To illustrate the performance of this method, I 
        will compare it with some of the existing image representation works and 
        reason the differences of their performances.</span></p>

    <td><p>Method:<br>
        <span class="middle">The whole pipeline of my project can be split into 
        2 parts: image representation and classification. The main methods related 
        to image representation include: <strong><font color="#FFFFFF">Image segmentation</font></strong> 
        which has been successfully used in content-based image analysis. These 
        segmentation-based algorithms first partition the whole image into small 
        blocks, say 4 * 4 pixels, then take into consideration of block¡¯s color, 
        texture, shape, etc as the basic features where the texture attibute is 
        always computed by doing <strong><font color="#FFFFFF">Wavelet Transformation</font></strong>. 
        Then the simple procedure to gather these blocks into several regions 
        is by using <strong><font color="#FFFFFF">Clustering Algorithm</font></strong>, 
        e.g. K-means. </span></p>
      <p><span class="middle"><br>
        Another method that shows how to convert the regions into an abstract 
        feature vector to represent the image is by optimizing the<strong><font color="#FFFFFF"> 
        Diverse Density </font></strong>value (Maron and Lozano-P¡äerez), which 
        is an objective function, defined over the region feature space and regions 
        can be viewed as points. A larger value of DD at a point indicates a higher 
        probability that the point fits better with the regions from positive 
        images than with those from negative.</span></p>
      <p><span class="middle"><br>
        After finishing mapping images into the new feature space, I will use 
        <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Classification method</strong></font> to 
        do the final step. Since classification is a well studied topic, the focus 
        will not cover new design of the novel classification algorithm, but by 
        choosing mature approaches, such as Logistic Regression, KNN.</span></p>
