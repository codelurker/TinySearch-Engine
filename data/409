<h2>things to check when tom can't run dvips</h2>
on his textbook and other stuff with the same latex setup..
<ul>
<li>NEW - I changed tom's *.fd files to only have lower
case font names in them.  Then I edited 
/usr/share/texmf/dvips/config/config.ps and added 
<pre>
p +/usr/share/texmf/fonts/map/dvips/tetex/mt-plus.map
</pre> which points to a new map file with the map file for teh y+y fonts in it.
Now it seems that psfonts.map is no longer included, and the
program <code>updmap</code> is no longer included.

<li>check /usr/share/texmf/dvips/config/psfonts.map<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;look for <pre>
RMTMI  RMTMI &lt;RMTMI.pfb
MTSYN  MTSYN &lt;MTSYN.pfb
RMTMIB RMTMIB &lt;RMTMIB.pfb
MTEX   MTEX &lt;MTEX.pfb
MTMS   MTMS &lt;MTMS.pfb 
MTSYB  MTSYB &lt;MTSYB.pfb
</pre>
Usually this is enough to fix things.  The times fonts seem to come with
RedHat linux nowadays.
<li>running /usr/share/texmf/dvips/config/updmap will make a new psfonts.map<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;this will overwrite what was done above

<li>edit /usr/share/texmf/dvips/config/config.ps<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;uncomment the lines for Type1 as specified

<li>check /usr/share/texmf/ls-R<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;first cd to /usr/share/texmf, then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;run /usr/bin/mktexlsr<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;this is necessary if fonts are added

<li> fonts are in..<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/share/texmf/fonts/tfm/MathTimes/ (tfm)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/share/texmf/fonts/tfm/MathTimesPlus/ (tfm)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/share/texmf/fonts/type1/MathTime/ (pfb)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/share/texmf/dvips/pfb/MathTime/ (pfb)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;not sure which of last two is read..  looks like <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/share/texmf/fonts/type1/MathTime<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/share/texmf/fonts/vf/MathTime<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/share/texmf/fonts/vf/MathTimePlus<br>

</ul>
