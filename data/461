          <h2>Affiliations</h2>
					I work with some great people as part of: the <a

					<h2>My Research</h2>
 I am a 4th year PhD student working with <a href='http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~campbell'>Andrew T.
 Campbell</a> in the Sensor Lab at Dartmouth. My research interests
 revolve around people-centric sensing applications and systems. I am an experimentalist who likes
 to build prototype mobile sensing systems based on well founded models.  I have worked on a variety of
 sensing platforms (e.g., mote-class sensors, mobile phones) and have experience not only in evaluating
 network and system performance but have conducted a number of user studies and analyzed sensor data; for
 example, when designing classifiers that recognize forms of human behavior.  Results from my research have
 been published in number of conferences including ACM SenSys, ACM MobiSys, Pervasive, and HotMobile. I have
 worked on a number of aspects of people-centric sensing systems including: system architecture, applications
 (e.g., CenceMe), localization, calibration, sensor co-ordination and the classification of high level events
 (e.g., music is playing) from a wide range of low-level sensor modalities (e.g., audio, location,
		 accelerometer). I have also worked in industry before leaping into research.
