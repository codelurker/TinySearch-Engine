architecture in which only the clients, but not the servers, care

	In this paper, we provide this missing piece: a credential system in

a credential system finds applications in, e.g., Vehicular Ad-hoc
Networks (VANets) and P2P networks.
	We formalize the security requirements of our proposed credential

construction. Our solution is efficient: its complexities are
independent of the number of users in the system.">

<b>Abstract:</b>
In the pursuit of authentication schemes that balance user privacy
and accountability, numerous anonymous credential systems have been
constructed. However, existing systems assume a client-server
architecture in which only the clients, but not the servers, care
about their privacy. In peer-to-peer (P2P) systems where both
clients and servers are peer users with privacy concerns, no
existing system correctly strikes that balance between privacy and
accountability.
</P><P>
	In this paper, we provide this missing piece: a credential system in
which peers are {\em pseudonymous} to one another (that is, two who
interact more than once can recognize each other via pseudonyms) but
are otherwise anonymous and unlinkable across different peers. Such
a credential system finds applications in, e.g., Vehicular Ad-hoc
Networks (VANets) and P2P networks.
</P><P>
	We formalize the security requirements of our proposed credential
system, provide a construction for it, and prove the security of our
construction. Our solution is efficient: its complexities are
independent of the number of users in the system.
