<h2>Assignments</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please include
CS 88/188 in the subject line of all your emails about the class and/or
assignments</span><br />

<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Paper Presentation</span><br />

You will be required to present a few of the papers that are being
discussed during the course. I recommend that you choose papers that
match most with your interests and with your final project.
Presentations should clearly address the paper's motivation, the
research contribution - specifically addressing the strengths and
weaknesses, and the results. <br />

<br />

Depending on the depth and difficulty of the
paper, make your presentation about 20-30 minutes long. I encourage you
to take a more investigate approach - what makes this paper
interesting? How could you do better? Think about the pros and cons
from different angle - usability, computational efficiency, complexity,
accuracy, and richness of the system or algorithm. The presentations
should be done using powerpoint or some other presentation software of
your
choice - I will request you to give me either a .ppt or .pdf version of
your slides.<br />

<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Written Critique </span><br />

Each student is required to submit a short written critique
(approximately 1 page) for each paper. It is due at 6pm the day before
the class. The critique should (i) identify and list the technical
challenges the researchers are trying to solve (ii) describe the new
ideas (iii) discuss the strength and limiations of the propsed approach
and (iv) suggest potential improvements.<br />

<br />

You can send me your critique either in plain text or pdf
attachment.&nbsp; if your are presenting a paper in class you do
not
need to send me a
written critique for that paper. I expect you to incorporate the
answers to the
questions into your presentation. Given the size of the class, I will
not be able to read every
single written critique which I deeply regret. I will randomly
sample&nbsp;
(uniformly across all students) a subset for which I will provide
feedback.&nbsp; <br />

<br />

Due: The day before class by 8pm EDT.<br />

<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Project Proposal</span><br />

Each student or group is required to submit a 1-2 page proposal for the
final project. The proposal should answer the following questions: (i)
what problem are you trying to solve? (ii) why is it important or
useful? (iii) what are the hard problems and how will solve them? (iv)
how will you evaluate/measure success?<br />

<br />

For a multi-person project, please include how you will divide the
tasks amongst yourselves. <br />

Due: October 15, 2008 by 12:00pm EDT <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">(note new
due date)</span><br />

<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Mid-term Presentation</span><br />

Each student or group is required to do a mid-term project presentation
and submit a written update on their progress on the final project
goals.<br />

Presentations will be on November 4 and 6, 2008<br />

<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Project Presentation and
Report</span><br />

Each student or group is required to do a final project presentation
and submit a written report (10 pages).
Presentations will be in class on December 2 and 3, 2008<br />

Project report due December 3, 2008 by 11:59pm EDT<br />
