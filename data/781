Theory Reading Group - Fall 2006
<br>
</b></center>
</font>

<blockquote> <p> Welcome to the Theory Reading Group at Dartmouth's CS
Department! We have vigorous, exciting discussions/presentations on
recent research in theoretical computer science (TCS), accompanied by
choice snacks. We meet on Fridays 3:00-4:30 in the Theory Lab (Sudikoff 
245) and sometimes in the Theory Reading Room (Kemeny 229). Everyone is 
welcome; email "ac" at "cs" if you'd like to join the discussion. 

<!--
Each term we center our discussions around a well-defined theme within
TCS. For the current term (Fall 2006) the theme is "Fourier analysis
and its applications in TCS".
-->

<h3>Fall 2006 Schedule</h3>

<p>

<p> <b>Sep 29, 2006</b> 
<ul> 
<li> This was a planning meeting.
</ul><p>

<p> <b>Oct 6, 2006 (Vibhor)</b>
<ul>
<li> Last term we were reading papers on the theme "Fourier analysis
and its applications in TCS". We had one paper we didn't quite get
to, so we shall be doing it now. Vibhor will present Khot and Naor's
paper <a href="Papers/khot-nonembed.pdf">Nonembeddability Theorems 
via Fourier Analysis</a>, from FOCS 2005.
</ul><p>

<p> <b>Oct 13, 2006 (Chrisil)</b>
<ul>
<li> We shall begin reading David Shmoys's survey
<a href="Papers/shmoys-multicut.ps">Cut Problems and their Application
to Divide-and-Conquer</a>. This builds the background for plenty of
recent work in algorithms and optimization.
</ul><p>

<p> <b>Oct 20, 2006 (Joshua)</b>
<ul>
<li> We shall continue with the Shmoys survey we started last time.
</ul><p>
