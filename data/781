Theory Reading Group - Spring 2006
<br>
</b></center>
</font>

<blockquote> <p> Welcome to the Theory Reading Group at Dartmouth's CS
Department! We have vigorous, exciting discussions/presentations on
recent research in theoretical computer science (TCS), accompanied by
choice snacks. We meet on Tuesdays 4:00-5:15 in Sudikoff 114. Everyone
is welcome; email "ac" at "cs" if you'd like to join the discussion. 

Each term we center our discussions around a well-defined theme within
TCS. For the current term (Spring 2006) the theme is "Fourier analysis
and its applications in TCS".

<p>
<h3>Spring 2006 Schedule </h3>

<p>

<p> <b>Apr 18, 2006 (Amit) &mdash; special meeting time 3:30-4:30</b> 
<ul> 
<li> Amit will introduce Fourier transforms over arbitrary Abelian
groups (in particular, discrete Fourier transforms). We will see an
example of how to compute Fourier coefficients for a simple but
important class of Boolean functions.
</ul><p>

<p> <b>Apr 25, 2006 (Amit)</b>
<ul>
<li> Amit will discuss the concept of influence of variables on a
Boolean function. We will see the proof of a classic theorem of Kahn,
Kalai and Linial about such influences. Here is the <a
href="Papers/kahn-influence.ps">original paper</a> and
here is <a href="Papers/stefankovic-fourier.ps">Stefankovic's Masters
thesis</a>, which we shall use as our source for the proof.
</ul><p>

<p> <b>May 2, 2006 (Joshua)</b>
<ul>
<li> Joshua will present a proof of Beckner's inequalities, which 
were used last time in the proof of the Kahn-Kalai-Linial theorem.
</ul><p>

<p> <b>May 9, 2006 (Anna)</b>
<ul>
<li> Anna will start discussing Hastad's landmark paper <a 
href="Papers/hastad-optimalinapprox.ps">Some Optimal Inapproximability
Results</a>. The discussion for this week will focus on the problem
of linear equations mod 2.
</ul><p>

<p> <b>May 16, 2006 (Anna)</b>
<ul>
<li> Anna will continue presenting Hastad's paper, and the result on the
inapproximability of max linear equations mod 2.
</ul><p>

<p> <b>May 23, 2006 (Joshua)</b>
<ul>
<li> Joshua will continue presenting Hastad's paper. We shall probably
focus on MAX-3SAT.
</ul><p>
