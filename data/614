<b>Abstract:</b>
Bounds have been proven for both training and testing error for the boosting
algorithm AdaBoost, but in practice neither seem to produce a particularly
tight bound.  In this paper we share some observations of these bounds from
empirical results, and then explore some properties of the algorithm with an
eye towards finding an improved bound for the performance of AdaBoost.
Based on our empirical evidence, the error of a hypothesis which labels
examples probabilistically based upon the confidence of the vote of the weak
hypotheses forms a tighter bound for the training error.
