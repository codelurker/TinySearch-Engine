<b> Year in Review: 2006 </b>
<p>

I hope that this email finds you all well.  I write to update you on
the happenings of the <a href="group.html">Image Science Group</a>.
The group currently consists of Kimo Johnson, Weihong Wang, Peter
Wayner and Jeff Woodward.

<p>

The lab continues to be incredibly productive and I am thrilled with
both the intellectual content of our research in digital forensics,
and in the impact it seems to be making in many corners of our
society.  The lab's success is due to all of the current and former
lab members who worked so hard -- to all of you, I am extremely
thankful.

<a href="http://www.mit.edu/~kimo/">Kimo Johnson</a> has been
developing some exciting and powerful new forensic tools with an
emphasis on lighting and optics.  Here is a link to some very nice
work that exploits optical aberrations to detect tampering:

<p>

<dd> Exposing Digital Forgeries Through Chromatic Aberration </dd> 
<dd> M.K. Johnson and H. Farid </dd> 
<dd> ACM Multimedia and Security Workshop, Geneva, Switzerland, 2006</dd> 
<dd> <a href="publications/acm06c.html">Abstract/Paper</a> </dd>

<p>

Kimo also worked through some complicated projective geometry and
showed how some recent results from the computer vision community
could be used in a forensic setting:

<p>

<dd> Metric Measurements on a Plane from a Single Image </dd>
<dd> M.K. Johnson and H. Farid </dd> 
<dd> Technical Report, TR2006-579, Dartmouth College, Computer Science </dd> 
<dd> <a href="publications/tr06.html">Abstract/Paper</a> </dd> 

<p>

Kimo defended his Ph.D. proposal earlier this year, and while I am
eager to keep Kimo in the lab for as long as possible, I expect that
he will defend his Ph.D. dissertation some time in 2007.

<a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~whwang/">Weihong Wang</a> has
been doing some excellent work in digital video forensics.  While the
field of image forensics is slowly growing, the field of video
forensics is currently non-existent, except for Weihong's first
publication that describes how to detect a doubly-compressed video
stream (this work expands on Alin Popescu's original work on detecting
double image compression).  Here is a link to the paper:

<dd> Exposing Digital Forgeries in Video by Detecting Double MPEG Compression </dd> 
<dd> W. Wang and H. Farid </dd> 
<dd> ACM Multimedia and Security Workshop, Geneva, Switzerland, 2006 </dd> 
<dd> <a href="publications/acm06b.html">Abstract/Paper</a> </dd>

<p>

Weihong's early work has already garnered the attention of the popular
press:

<dd> <a href="press/techreview06.html"> Detecting Video Forgeries </a> in Technology Review </dd>
<dd> <a href="press/news.com06a.html">Are Fake Videos Next?</a> in News.com </dd>

<p>

We are currently working on several other ideas and I expect Weihong
to defend his Ph.D. proposal sometime in 2007.

<p>

<p>
<HR>
<p>

Both Peter Wayner and Jeff Woodward have been working with us to help
port all of our forensics work into a stand-alone software that can be
used by a forensic examiner.  Thanks to their efforts, we are making
significant progress and hope to have a beta-version to law
enforcement by the summer of 2007.

<p>
<HR>
<p>

As for me, most significantly, I was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship
and in return given a year of sabbatical by Dartmouth.  I am spending
most of my time in Santa Cruz, CA where I continue to collaborate with
industry partners, and spend long days thinking, reading and writing.
I was also promoted to Full Professor.  As always, you can find on my
web page copies of our <a
href="publications/publications.html">papers</a> and <a
href="publications/publications.html#popularpress">popular press</a>
accounts of our work.

<p>

In alumni news, 
<ul>

<li> <a href="http://www.cs.albany.edu/~lsw/">Siwei Lyu</a> has been a
postdoc at NYU for the past few years where he has continued to do
exciting research in the area of natural image statistics.

<li> Dave Martin is living in Seattle, WA with his wife, and is
working at Wily Technologies where his work has him specializing in
Java performance for large web applications.

<li> Senthil Periaswamy became a father for the second time, and is
working at Siemens in Philadelphia, PA doing some excellent work in
various areas of medical imaging.

<li> Alin Popescu is working at Renesys Inc. here in Hanover, NH and
has been enjoying the algorithmic and systems-oriented challenges of
the job.

<li> <a href="http://www.jethrofilms.com">Jethro Rothe-Kushel</a> has
been living in Los Angeles, CA and working in various corners of the
movie industry.  Check out his website to see some of his work.

<li> Kate Sherwin has moved to Austin, TX.  Having spent the past few
years racing her bicycle professionally, Kate will be taking a job
working in the field of computational finance.

<li> Hai Sun has finished his M.D. and is currently interviewing for
residency positions.
