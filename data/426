<h1>Tiny Trusted Third Parties</h1>

<h2>Workshop Paper</h2>
<p>
<a href="../papers/watc2006.html">Faerieplay on Tiny Trusted Third
Parties</a>. We present our work to overcome barriers to the deployment of Secure
Multiparty Computation assisted by a Trusted Third Party (TTP) in the
form of hardware-based trustworthy devices, like the IBM 4758 secure
coprocessor.  We focus on the effective use of <emph>tiny</emph> TTPs (<emph>
T3Ps</emph>). To eliminate the difficulty of programming a small secure
device while preserving critical trust properties, in concurrent work
we designed and prototyped an efficient system, called Faerieplay, to
execute <emph>arbitrary</emph> programs on T3Ps securely. To eliminate the
performance and cost obstacles of using secure coprocessors, we are
currently examining the potential hardware design for a T3P optimized
for bottleneck operations. We estimate that such a T3P could
outperform the 4758 by several orders of magnitude, while also having
a gate-count of only 30K-60K, one to three orders of magnitude smaller
than the 4758 or hardened CPU systems like AEGIS. We are currently
proceeding with a proof-of-concept prototype on a Xilinx FPGA.

<h2>Technical Reports</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/reports/abstracts/TR2005-547/">Towards Tiny
Trusted Third Parties</a>. Here we outline our hardware design for a tiny TTP,
which is optimized for operations like emulating a re-encrypting sorting
network. These operations dominate the running time of Oblivious RAM and
Practical PIR algorithms.

<a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/reports/abstracts/TR2005-551/"> More
Efficient Secure Function Evaluation Using Tiny Trusted Third Parties</a>. Here
we describe our circuit-based Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) system, which
uses tiny TTPs, and improves efficiency with indirect arrays. Indirect arrays
are a major weakness with exisiting non-TTP protocols.
