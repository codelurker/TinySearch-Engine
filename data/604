</P><P>
  Cryptography is an ancient art that has passed through many
paradigms, from simple letter substitutions to polyalphabetic
substitutions to rotor machines to digital encryption to public-key
cryptosystems.  With the possible advent of quantum computers and the
strange behaviors they exhibit, a new paradigm shift in cryptography
may be on the horizon.  Quantum computers could hold the potential to
render most modern encryption useless against a quantum-enabled
adversary.  The aim of this thesis is to characterize this convergence
of cryptography and quantum computation.
</P><P>
  We provide definitions for cryptographic primitives that frame them
in general terms with respect to complexity.  We explore the various
possible relationships between BQP, the primary quantum complexity
class, and more familiar classes, and we analyze the possible
implications for cryptography.
