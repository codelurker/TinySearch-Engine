<h1>Installing Java 5.0 and Eclipse on Mac OS X</h1>

This page tells you how to download Java 5.0 and Eclipse for Mac OS X.
If you need help, Blitz <a
href="mailto:cs5help@cs.dartmouth.edu">cs5help@cs.dartmouth.edu</a>.

<p>

<strong>You must be running Mac OS 10.4 or later (i.e.,
Tiger or Leopard).</strong> To determine which version of the Mac OS you are
running, click on the blue apple at the very upper left of your
screen, and select "About This Mac".  A window will pop up, and it
will tell you which version of Mac OS you are running.  If you are running 10.5, you may be able 
to skip the Java installation step.  

<p>

Note: You'll see throughout the websites references to "Java 5.0",
"Java 1.5", and "Java 1.5.0".  However, all of them refer to the same
version of Java.  Blame Sun's marketing people.  We consider them all
the same, and we'll call them all "Java 5.0".  

<p>

<h2>Downloading and installing Java 5.0</h2>

<ul>

  <li>  
       If you are running Mac OS X version 10.5, go to  
       <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/javaformacosx105update2.html">this link</a>. Where it says "File size: 136.4.7MB," click on the "136.4MB" to
       download the file.

    
      <li>  
       If you are running Mac OS X version 10.4, go to  
       <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/javaformacosx104release7.html">this link</a>. 
       
       Where it says "File size: 79.7MB," click on the "79.7MB" to
       download the file.
  
       
  <li> After downloading, Apple will present you a dialog (i.e., a
       series of popup windows) that take you through the build process.  You
       should be able to take the default choice ("Continue," "OK," "Agree,"
       "Close," "Upgrade," etc.) for all options.
       
       <p>

       You may be asked to authenticate before continuing.  This will
       depend on how your preferences are set.  Type in your password
       as you would if you were logging in on your computer.  Don't
       worry!  This is just so that your computer knows you really
       have the authority to install something on it!

       <p>

       If you don't automatically get the dialog, then double-click on
       the "JavaForMacOSX10.4Release7.dmg" icon, and you should see a disk icon
       named "Java for Mac OS X 10.4, Release 7".
       Open that by double-clicking
       if it's not already open, and then double-click on
       "JavaForMacOSX10.4Release7.pkg".  At that point, you'll get the dialog.

  <li> When it says "Select a destination volume", choose your hard drive.

  <li> There should now be two files on your desktop or download area starting with "J2SE".
       Feel free to delete these after finishing the installation.
       You can always download them again later if you need to.

  <li> If at any point, you see a message such as "This volume contains
       a newer version of Java" you can just click on the Close button.
       It means that you already had the version of Java that you need!
       
</ul>

<h2>Downloading and installing Eclipse</h2>

<ul>
     <li> Click this 
       <a href="eclipse-SDK-3.4.2-macosx-carbon.tar.gz">
       link</a> to download the file eclipse-SDK-3.4.2-macosx-carbon.tar.gz.


  <li> After finishing the download, you may be prompted with a warning
       that the file may contain an application.  Ignore this warning and
       continue by clicking "Download".  The Mac will then decompress
       the downloaded file automatically.  If it does not, then just
       double-click on the downloaded file (whose name ends with
       ".gz"). You should now have a folder named "eclipse" on
       your desktop.

  <li> Now, you need to move the eclipse folder to your Applications
       directory.  Double-click on your hard drive, and within that, double
       click on the "Applications" folder.  Drag your eclipse folder from the
       Desktop into this folder.

  <li> Inside your eclipse folder is an Eclipse application; its icon is
       a purple circle with three white stripes.
       <p>
       <CENTER>
       <img src="EclipseFolderMac.jpg">
       </CENTER>
       <p>

       Click on this icon to run Eclipse.
     
  <li> (Optional, but highly recommended.) Drag the Eclipse icon to the
       Dock.  Click on it there to run Eclipse.  If you don't drag your Eclipse
       icon to the Dock, then you'll have to double-click on it in your
       Applications folder each time you want to run Eclipse.  It's much
       easier from the Dock.  You can always remove Eclipse from the Dock
       later on (as in, after this course is over).

</ul>

<h2>Configuring Eclipse</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Run Eclipse.
     
  <li> It asks you to select a workspace.  By default, this will be
       a folder named "workspace" in
       your home directory.  For example, on my Mac the default
       is /Users/scot/workspace.

       I recommend that you put your workspace in your Documents folder.
       If you click before "/workspace" and enter "/Documents" (so
       on my Mac it becomes "/Users/scot/Documents/workspace") you will
       get this.

       If you don't want to see this message every time you start up Eclipse,
       before clicking "OK," check "Use this as the default
       and do not ask again."

       <p>
       <center>
       <img src="WSMac.jpg">
       </center>
       <p>

  <li> The first time you launch Eclipse, you'll probably see this startup
       window.  Click on the arrow symbol toward the right:
       
       <p>
       <center>
       <img src="EclipseStartupWindow.gif">
       </center>
       <p>

       Don't worry if you don't see this startup window.
       You shouldn't see it again after the first time.

  <li> You'll see a window with various buttons and panes, but nothing
       of consequence in it:
              
       <p>
       <center>
       <img src="EclipseEmptyProject.jpg">
       </center>
       <p>
     
<!--   <li> In the Eclipse menu bar, click on Window->Preferences...  This -->
<!--        will bring up a window with two panes.  On the left is a list of -->
<!--        things you can configure. -->

<!--   <li> Click on the triangle to the left of "Java" to open up the list -->
<!--        of Java configuration options.  Click on "Compiler" (click the word, -->
<!--        not the triangle next to it).  On the right is a list of Java Compiler -->
<!--        options. -->

<!--        <p> -->
<!--        <CENTER> -->
<!--        <img src="CompilerPrefsWindow.jpg"> -->
<!--        </CENTER> -->

<!--        Change the "Compiler compliance level" to 5.0, and click "OK." -->
     
<!-- <\!--   <li> You should get a message at the bottom of the screen that states -\-> -->
<!-- <\!--        "When selecting 5.0 compliance, make sure to have a 5.0 GRE installed -\-> -->
<!-- <\!--        and activated.  Configure..." Click on "Configure..."  This takes you -\-> -->
<!-- <\!--        to a list of JREs. -\-> -->

<!-- <\!--        <ul> -\-> -->

<!-- <\!-- 	 <li> If there is one for JVM 1.5, select it. -\-> -->

<!-- <\!-- 	 <li> Otherwise, Click "Add..."  to add a new JRE.  For the -\-> -->
<!-- <\!-- 	      JRE name, use "JVM 1.5".  For the JRE home directory, browse to find -\-> -->
<!-- <\!-- 	      the home directory of the JRE you just installed.  By default, mine -\-> -->
<!-- <\!-- 	      installed to -\-> -->
<!-- <\!-- 	      "System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.Frameworks/Versions/1.5/Home". -\-> -->

<!-- <\!-- 	 <li> After making the above changes, Eclipse will ask if you want to -\-> -->
<!-- <\!-- 	      do a full rebuild.  Click "Yes". -\-> -->

<!-- <\!--        </ul> -\-> -->

<!--        <li> You will be asked whether to do a full rebuild.  Click "Yes." -->

</ul>

Congratulations.  You have installed Java 5.0 and Eclipse, and you
have configured Eclipse!

<h2>Configuring Eclipse to make it like mine</h2>

You may want to make your version of Eclipse look like mine, so that what you see
in class is what appears on your screen.  Do the
following.

<ul>
     
  <li> In the Eclipse menu bar, click on Eclipse and then on
       Preferences...  This
       will bring up a window with two panes.  On the left is a list of
       things you can configure.

  <li> Click on the triangle to the left of "General."  Then click on
       the triangle to the left of "Appearance."  Then click on
       "Colors and Fonts."  You should see a window like this:
                                   
       <p>
       <center>
       <img src="ColorsAndFonts1.jpg">
       </center>
       <p>

  <li> In the scrollable window in the middle, click on the triangle
       next to "Java."  Then scroll down within that window and
       <em>double-click</em> on "Java Editor Text Font."
                                   
       <p>
       <center>
       <img src="ColorsAndFonts2.jpg">
       </center>
       <p>

       As you can see, there's some text following "Java Editor Text Font."
       Don't worry about it.

  <li> The following window will pop up:
                                   
       <p>
       <center>
       <img src="ColorsAndFonts3.jpg">
       </center>
       <p>

       On the right, where you can select the size, click "12".
       Then close this window by clicking on the window's close button.

  <li> Close up the "General" preferences by clicking on the triangle to
       the left of "General."  Click the triangle next to "Java" and
       then click the triangle next to "Code Style."
       Then click "Formatter."  Here's what you should see:
                                   
       <p>
       <center>
       <img src="Formatter1.jpg">
       </center>
       <p>

  <li> Click the button that says "New..."  You'll see a window such
       as this one:
                                   
       <p>
       <center>
       <img src="Formatter2.jpg">
       </center>
       <p>

       You can type in any profile name you like.  I used "CS 5":
                                   
       <p>
       <center>
       <img src="Formatter2a.jpg">
       </center>
       <p>

       Then click "OK."

  <li> You should see a window that looks like this:
                                   
       <p>
       <center>
       <img src="Formatter3.jpg">
       </center>
       <p>

       Change the Tab size to 2:
                                          
       <p>
       <center>
       <img src="Formatter4.jpg">
       </center>
       <p>

       You'll see that the Indentation size automatically changes as well.

  <li> Click on "Blank Lines," (in the menu bar across the top of the page)
        and after "Between import groups" and
       "Before declarations of the same kind," change the values
       1 to 0:
                                          
       <p>
       <center>
       <img src="Formatter5.jpg">
       </center>
       <p>

  <li> Click on "Control Statements," and check the boxes as I've done
       here:
                                          
       <p>
       <center>
       <img src="Formatter6.jpg">
       </center>
       <p>

       Click "OK."

  <li> Now click on triangles to close up "Java."  Click on the
       triangle next to "Run/Debug," and then click on "Console."
                                          
       <p>
       <center>
       <img src="Console1.jpg">
       </center>
       <p>

  <li> Click on the green color sample next to "Standard In text color."
       You'll get a color picker:
                                          
       <p>
       <center>
       <img src="Console2.jpg">
       </center>
       <p>

  <li> Slide the slider on the right down, so that you get a dark green.
       (You're at Dartmouth.  What other color could you possibly want?)
                                          
       <p>
       <center>
       <img src="Console3.jpg">
       </center>
       <p>

       Click "OK" to close the color picker window, and click "OK"
       again to close the Preferences window.

  <li> Finally, I don't use the Task List and Outline panes, which
       are on the right-hand side of the window.  Click on the "X"
       next to "Task List" and next to "Outline" in the tabs of these
       panes:
                                          
       <p>
       <center>
       <img src="TaskListOutline.gif">
       </center>
       <p>

       You'll get something like this:
                                          
       <p>
       <center>
       <img src="EclipseDone.jpg">
       </center>
       <p>

       Now you've got your Eclipse set up the same as mine!

</ul>
