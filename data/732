<h2>Final Project</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify;">I will provide a few
project ideas
but you are&nbsp; encouraged to choose a topic (with my approval)
that
matches your research interests. Students are encouraged to do projects
in groups of two but individual projects are also acceptable. Group
projects need to have roughly twice the contribution of an individual
project. Feel free to use the available datasets (with proper
reference) for your project - <br />

<a style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/%7Etanzeem/teaching/CS188-Fall08/dataset.html">
http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~tanzeem/teaching/CS188-Fall08/dataset.html</a></div>

<br />

You can choose one of two different flavors of projects -<br />

<br />

A project where you implement some of the main ideas from a paper you
read in class but explore a new application scenario or create a new
and compelling demo.<br />

<br />

<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">OR</span><br />

</div>

<br />

<div style="text-align: justify;">A project where you
propose a new
algorithm (or an extension to an exisiting algorithm) that is related
to one of the techniques covered in class. You will be graded on the
novelty and depth of your idea as well as the implementation. For this
type of project you won't be penalized if your idea does not give you
the result you expect. But you should make a convincing argument for
why you think your idea will be successful in your proposal and devoted
enough time exploring why the idea did not work.<br />

<h2>The fine print ...</h2>

Those of you who are first year graduate students and
are unsure about the scope of the project - please come talk to me. It
may seem like a daunting task at first but projects can be fun and a
great way to get started on research. I will provide some project ideas
after October 2, 2008. But first I wanted to give you the opportunity
to think about the types of problem that excite you before biasing your
thinking. Depending on your interest and experience I am happy to work
with you in finding a project that will be a good fit - not all
projects have to have a lot of coding. You can explore ideas on how
computational systems can be used by people - if you want to propose
interesting user study or behavioral experiment towards that goal I am
happy to work with you in figuring out the right project. If you are
mathematically inclined and want to develop a new algorithm you are
welcome to do so but you need to have some way to evaluate your
techniques with real data (this can simply be coding it up in Matlab
and running some experiments).
