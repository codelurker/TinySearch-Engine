<h2><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Course</span></h2>































<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">"How can I really call myself a CS major and not be a hacker?" -&nbsp; CS23 is your answer.<br>











<br>











The ORC: Techniques
for building large, reliable, maintainable, and understandable software
systems. Topics include UNIX tools and filters, programming in C,
software testing, debugging, and teamwork in software development.
Concepts are reinforced through a small number of medium-scale programs
and one team programming project. <br>
























<br>





























More specifically: The course teaches Linux, C and shell
programming,&nbsp; the use of GNU development tools (gcc, gdb, make,
valgrind, gprofile, cvs) and design and implementation techniques. As part of the
course you will design and implement the <span style="font-weight: bold;">TinySearchEngine</span>&nbsp;as part of a
series of programming assignments - then you can take on google! The
course includes a group project&nbsp;based on programming <span style="font-weight: bold;">embedded Linux robots</span>. &nbsp;You will also be exposed to thread, socket and embedded systems programming.<br>











<br>




























Note, there is a significant amount of programming in
this course&nbsp;requiring a significant time commitment on the part of the student. <br>




























<br>











The course breaks down
into seven/eight weeks of lectures and labs with the remaining time
held
over for&nbsp;group projects. The projects will be organized around a
design review, code review and demo or die event. Something similar to
what you would experience in the software industry when you have to
ship a beta.</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>





</span>
<h2><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">What you will learn</span></h2>





<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">






















<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Some Linux,
bash shell programming, C programming,&nbsp;
programming tools, how to design, implement and debug a complex
software system by working together in small groups. We hope that the
skills learnt and
experience gained will reflect what you would expect in the software
industry when working in small teams. The two main programming
challenges are the TinySearchEngine specifically developed for this
Dartmouth CS class - which represents a complex standalone software
system - and real-time distributed client/server programming using the
robots.</span></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"> You will learn about </span></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">real-time </span></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">distributed programming issues: you will</span></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"> programming embedded Linux robots (the&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Garcia </span></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">below)</span></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"> and learn
about the sensors that the robot&nbsp; interacts with as it roams around&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Sudikoff</span></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
on a treasure hunt, searching for what ... &nbsp;some photos from the
CS23 bot treasure hunt and bot race here. &nbsp;Yes, we like to <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/%7Epway/cs23/robot/">race robots in Sudikoff</a>.<br>











<br>











</span></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">












This is a fun, exciting but challenging </span></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">class</span></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">.
Note, there are no midterm or final exams - just design, programming,
and a lot of debugging; you will learn all about segfaults, memory
leaks, and core dumps. Also, we don't use any fancy IDEs (e.g., the popular Eclipse integrated development environment)
in this class - everything is on the <span style="font-style: italic;">command line</span>. We expose details to gain knowledge rather than promote abstraction. </span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>











<br>











In breif, C23 is the class I never had as an undergrad - it's a crash
course in design, C/Unix programming, process/threads, GNU tools,
socket
programming and the implementation of complex standalone and embedded
software systems - it's a course where you will </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"> write approximately <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/%7Ecampbell/cs23/assignments.html">3000 lines of C and 500 lines of bash script</a> for the programming assignments and&nbsp; 1000 lines for the joint project; as a result, you will </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">gain tangible
programming skills; it will turn you into a systems hacker or your
money back!&nbsp; <br>

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>



























There will be a
discussion in class regarding the course reading material. Active
involvement in that discussion, the classs, the lab - will help toward the class contribution
part of the grade.<br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">











</span>















<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"></span><br>



























<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">60% - Laboratory exercises</span> (10% for each lab)</span><br>



























<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>




There are 7 weekly laboratory assignments over the first 8 weeks. These
labs are designed to help you learn the languages, tools, and design
skills you will need for your final project. Only six labs are graded -
10% is given for each lab. Some labs are harder than others but we have
a flat grading scheme across all labs. These assignments are to be done
individually. The schedule is <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/%7Ecampbell/cs23/assignments.html">online</a>&nbsp;- plan a head. You need to be
organized to get through the labs and stay on schedule.<br>




</span><br>




We will provide source code solutions to all labs. The TA will grade your solutions and write up a grade sheet
on the correctness, simplicity, and clarity of your code. The
instructor will review the TA's grading and grade sheets. Your grade
and grade sheet and our source code solution will be mailed to you one week after the lab assignment
is turned in. If you have questions about the grade or grade sheet
please talk to the TA first. If you are still have concerns see the
instructor. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Please do not distribute the source code solutions we provide you with (see honor code).</span> <br>


























<br>


























<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">30% - Team project</span> </span><br>


























<br>


























The project is made up of a small team (three or four people)
and&nbsp;requires strong collaboration and a problem solving mindset to
get the job done. The instructor will put the teams together with each
member being responsible to deliver against a part of the overal system
design, implementation, testing and integration.&nbsp; The goals of
this activity are to help you develop the confidence, skills, and
habits necessary to write large computer programs while part of a
multi-person team. You will become conversant in software engineering
paradigms, and be exposed to various public-domain and open source
tools that make the software development process easier. In addition,
you will develop vital skills in self-directed learning, problem
solving, and communication. The project will have a design and code
review as well as the demo. A project report that captures the design
and implementation will be submitted as part of the assesment.<br>

























<h2><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Policy for late assignments</span></h2>

























Unless prior arrangements have been made, or in case of medical or
family emergencies, or specific disabilities, all assignments are
subject to the following policy regarding late submissions:<br>

























<br>

























Programming assignments&nbsp;must be submitted according to the schedule; if late, the following grade penalties are assessed:<br>

























<br>

























Late &lt; 8 hours<br>

























&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten percent (10%) will be deducted from the final score.<br>

























Late &ge; 8 hours and &lt; 24 hours<br>

























&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twenty percent (20%) will be deducted from the final score.<br>

























Late &ge; 24 hours and &lt; 48 hours<br>

























&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forty percent (40%) will be deducted from the final score.<br>

























Late 48 or more hours<br>

























&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak to the lecturer.<br>
















<br>
















Two free passes for 48 hour extension with no penalty. Keep these for the more challenging programming assignments.<br>














<br>














Caveat: Students get stressed with the demanding programming assignments that is why I provide the two free passes. Key thing<br>













is to come talk to me if you feel you are not making progress on assignments. The most important
thing for you to do is to&nbsp;to finish the programming assignment <br>













even if late.<br>

<h2><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Lab access</span></h2>





























<span style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">In
order to obtain access to Sudikoff after hours, and to get into
Sudikoff's Lab 001, you will need to have your Dartmouth ID card
activated for the appropriate access.
To do this, stop by and see Christine at 101 Sudikoff on a weekday between
8:30am-12:00pm, or 1:00-4:00pm, and bring your Dartmouth ID card.
Inform Kelly that you are taking CS23, and require access to Lab 001.
You will have to fill out and sign a form stating that you understand
the various policies about access to the labs in Sudikoff.</span><br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">





























<br style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">





























<span style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Keep in mind that it may take 24 hours for access to be activated, so please plan ahead!</span><br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">





























<br style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">





























<span style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">You
will also require a computer account on the CS Linux machines. Contact
Andrew Campbell, via email, informing him of your preferred (new)
account name.</span><br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">





























<br style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">





























<span style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Please
note that the exterior doors of Sudikoff are automatically locked after
6:00pm weekdays, and also every weekend and holiday. In addition, the
laboratory doors are locked at all times. You will need your access
card to pass through locked doors.</span><br>





























<span style="font-weight: normal;"></span>
<h2><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Books</span></h2>





























<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
There is no one book that caters for the material in the course.
&nbsp;However, we do recommend a book on the C language - this is a very good book:</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">






























<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">






























<img style="width: 90px; height: 90px;" alt="" src="base_media.jpg"><br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">

Bronson</a><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">






























<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">





























<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">We do not
recommend you buy any other books for the course. But If I were to
recommend a book on design and programming for Unix and C it would be
this </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">classic</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"> text:</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">





























<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
If I where to recommend a hands on book on Linux and shell programming&nbsp; it would be this one (lots of good stuff in this):</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">






























<h2 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><img style="width: 84px; height: 105px;" alt="" src="books.jpg"></h2>






























<a style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0131478230">A Practical Guide to Linux Commands, Editors, and Shell Programming by Mark G. Sobell</a><br>




























<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">



























<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Another really good book covering, debugging, processes, threads, and socket programming in clear and easy manner to grasp:<br>














<br>














<img style="width: 100px; height: 124px;" alt="Linux Programming" src="linuxprogbook.jpg"><br>














<br>














<a href="http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/productCd-0470147628.html">Beginning Linux Programming, 4th Edition by Neil Matthew, Richard Stones</a><br>














<br>














Just to make things clear. Buy the ANSI C book for the course. But if
you are interested in hacking C, shell scripts, Linux you might like
the other books for your library. They are all really nice books - I love them.<br>

</span></span>
<h2><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Policy on Joint Work and the Dartmouth Honor Code</span></h2>




















<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">The assignments and project are all about writing great code - shell scripts and C. Here is the policy for joint work in CS23:</span><br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">




















<br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">




















<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">First, you may
discuss and help each other (e.g., help in debugging, sharing
knowledge, giving moral support, getting coffee, etc.) - I promote that
as the type of team spirit and joint problem solving skills that is the
essense of the course and necessary to do a great project. However -
there if always a however or but, right, - you cannot work jointly on
coding up (i.e., writing) your programming assignments. You can talk,
discuss solutions, even show snippets of code on the white board (not
the computer) to solve a problem but you cannot jointly work on
the&nbsp;code development and writing. Submitted code for the labs has
to be yours and yours alone. </span><br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">




















<br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">




















<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">The project
phase is different. You can work jointly on writing code. But you
cannot take code from anywhere (e.g., the web or any other source). It
has to be the joint product of the team. One caveat: no sharing of code
between teams. As above, teams can discuss code, show each other
snippets on the white board, but not share source code. The project
phase of the course is a friendly competition so there isn't a lot of
incentive to share code.</span><br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">




















<br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">




















<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">We hate to state
this since you all know it but it is necessary to be explicit here
(citation - culled and extended from CS8 Policy on joint work):</span><br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">




















<br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">




















<table style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" width="100%">





















  <tbody>




















    <tr>




















      <td><span style="color: rgb(0, 51, 0);">You would be amazed at
how easy it is to tell when people work together
on problem sets, particularly coding exercises. Think about the simple
shell
commands we can run against your source code from labs and projects,
or, the shell script we can use to compare your lab assignments and
projects against every other assignment and project ever submitted to
us - it would take less that a millisecond to run these checks - no
effort on our behalf. Similarly, we know how to use google too. You
should not under any circumstance look at or use code from previous
terms' CS23 assignments and projects. Our scripts are smarter than
that. The message is - please don't make life unpleasant for all of us
by breaking these rules. The penalties for cheating at Dartmouth are
severe, starting with suspension and including expulsion. If you are
unsure about anything, please ask</span>.</td>

</table>




















<br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">




















<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">We take the
Honor Code very seriously, so please, if you are unclear on any matter
regarding this policy, do not hesitate to see me in office hours, and
we will be more than happy to answer your questions. </span><br>
