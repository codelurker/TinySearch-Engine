<h1>Installing Java and Eclipse on Windows</h1>

This page tells you how to download Java and Eclipse for Windows.
It is oriented toward Windows XP, but the instructions should work for
Windows Vista as well, except that there will be minor cosmetic
differences in the screen shots and a few changes noted below.

Congratulations.  You have installed Java and Eclipse, and you
have configured Eclipse!

<h2>Configuring Eclipse to make it like mine</h2>

You should make your version of Eclipse look like mine.  Do the
following.
<p>

<ul>
     
  <li> In Eclipse, click Window -> Preferences.  This
       will bring up a window with two panes.  On the left is a list of
       things you can configure.

  <li> Click the plus sign to the left of "General."  Then click on
       the plus sign to the left of "Appearance."  Then click on
       "Colors and Fonts."  You should see a window like this:
                                   
       <p>

       <center>
       <img src="custom01.jpg">
       </center>
       <p>

  <li> In the scrollable window in the middle, click on the plus sign
       next to "Java."  Then scroll down within that window and
       <em>double-click</em> on "Java Editor Text Font."
                                   
       <p>
       <center>

       <img src="custom02.jpg">
       </center>
       <p>

       As you can see, there's some text following "Java Editor Text Font."
       Don't worry about it.

  <li> The following window will pop up:
                                   
       <p>
       <center>
       <img src="custom03.jpg">
       </center>

       <p>

       On the right, where you can select the size, click "12".
       Then close this window by clicking on the window's close button.

  <li> Close up the "General" preferences by clicking on the minus sign to
       the left of "General."  Click the plus sign next to "Java" and
       then click the plus sign next to "Code Style."
       Then click "Formatter."  Here's what you should see:
                                   
       <p>
       <center>
       <img src="custom04.jpg">
       </center>
       <p>

  <li> Click the button that says "New..."  You'll see a window such
       as this one:
                                   
       <p>
       <center>
       <img src="custom05.jpg">
       </center>
       <p>

       You can type in any profile name you like.  I used "CS 5":
                                   
       <p>
       <center>

       <img src="custom06.jpg">
       </center>
       <p>

       Then click "OK."

  <li> You should see a window that looks like this:
                                   
       <p>
       <center>
       <img src="custom07.jpg">
       </center>

       <p>

       Change the Tab size to 2:
                                          
       <p>
       <center>
       <img src="custom08.jpg">
       </center>
       <p>

       You'll see that the Indentation size automatically changes as well.

  <li> Click on "Blank Lines," and after "Between import groups" and
       "Before declarations of the same kind," change the values
       1 to 0:
                                          
       <p>

       <center>
       <img src="custom09.jpg">
       </center>
       <p>

  <li> Click on "Control Statements," and check the boxes as I've done
       here:
                                          
       <p>
       <center>
       <img src="custom10.jpg">

       </center>
       <p>

       Click "OK."

  <li> Now click on the minus signs to close up "Java."  Click on the
       triangle next to "Run/Debug," and then click on "Console."
                                          
       <p>
       <center>
       <img src="custom11.jpg">
       </center>
       <p>

  <li> Click on the green color sample next to "Standard In text color."
       You'll get a color picker. Select a dark green. (You're at Dartmouth.  
			 What other color could you possibly want?)
                                          
       <p>
       <center>
       <img src="custom12.jpg">
       </center>
       <p>

       Click "OK" to close the color picker window, and click "OK"
       again to close the Preferences window.

  <li> Finally, I don't use the Task List and Outline panes, which
       are on the right-hand side of the window.  Click on the "X"
       next to "Task List" and next to "Outline" in the tabs of these
       panes:
                                          
       <p>
       <center>
       <img src="custom13.gif">

       </center>
       <p>

       You'll get something like this:
                                          
       <p>
       <center>
       <img src="custom14.jpg">
       </center>
       <p>

       Now you've got your Eclipse set up the same as mine!
