<b>Abstract:</b>
Near-infrared (NIR) optical image reconstruction that incorporates
blood oxygen level dependant (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging has the
potential to improve both quantifiable measurement of oxygenation and
the spatial resolution involved in such mapping.  My thesis continues
some preliminary work in this area through development of an analytic
diffusion parameter estimation algorithm for use with a NIR imaging
array and development of a finite element mesh utility to read a
priori BOLD images and tag them with property elements for NIR image
resolution improvement.
