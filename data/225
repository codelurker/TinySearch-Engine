<b>Computational Topology</b>

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word <em>topology</em> is 
derived of <em>topos</em> (&tau;&omicron;&pi;&omicron;&sigmaf;)
meaning <em>place</em>, and 
<em>-logy</em> (&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&iota;&alpha;),
a variant of the verb &lambda;&epsilon;&gamma;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;, meaning
<em>to speak</em>.
As such, topology speaks about places:  how local neighborhoods connect to
each other to form a space.
Computational topology, in turn, undertakes the challenge of studying
topology using a computer.

<b>Colon Polyp Detection using Smoothed Shape Operators:  Preliminary

Computer-aided detection (CAD) algorithms identify locations in Computed
Tomographic (CT) images of the colon that are most likely to contain
polyps. 
In this paper, we present the Smoothed Shape Operators method
(SSO), which uses a geometry processing approach. 
We extract a triangle
mesh representation of the colon surface, and estimate curvature on this
surface using the shape operator. We then smooth the shape operators on
the surface iteratively. 
We evaluate our algorithm on patient data and
provide free-response receiver operating characteristic performance
analysis over all size ranges of polyps. We also provide confidence
intervals for our performance estimates. We compare our performance with
the Surface Normal Overlap (SNO) method for the same data.

<b>On the Local Behavior of Spaces of Natural Images.</b>

<br>
In this study, we concentrate on qualitative topological analysis of the
local behavior of the space of natural images. To this end, we use a space
of 3 by 3 high-contrast patches <em>M</em> studied by Mumford et
al.  We develop a theoretical model for the high-density 2-dimensional
submanifold of <em>M</em> showing that it has the topology of the Klein
bottle.  Using our topological software package <em>PLEX</em> we experimentally
verify our theoretical conclusions.  We use polynomial representation to
give coordinatization to various subspaces of <em>M</em>. We find the
best-fitting embedding of the Klein bottle into the ambient space of
 <em>M</em>. Our results are currently being used in developing a
compression algorithm based on a Klein bottle dictionary.

Membrane fusion constitutes a key stage in cellular processes such as
synaptic neurotransmission and infection by enveloped viruses.
We introduce a novel structural 
measurement of vesicle topology and fusion geometry: persistent voids.
We use persistent voids to
compute dynamic relationships between hemifusion neck widening and
formation of a full fusion pore in our simulation data. 
Our findings suggest that rapid fusion between small vesicles proceeds
via a small hemifusion diaphragm rather than a full-expanded one.

In this paper, we provide a complete theoretical foundation and an

our theory is general and localizes arbitrary-dimensional attributes in 
arbitrary spaces.
We implement our algorithm to validate our approach in practice.

Persistent homology captures the topology of a filtration &ndash; 
a one-parameter
family of increasing spaces &ndash; in terms of a complete discrete invariant.
This invariant is a multiset of intervals that denote the lifetimes of the
topological entities within the filtration.
In many applications of topology, we need to study a multifiltration:
a family of spaces parameterized along multiple geometric dimensions.
In this paper, we show that no complete discrete invariant exists for 
multidimensional persistence.
We also propose a discrete invariant, the <em>rank invariant</em>, for the 
robust estimation of Betti numbers in a multifiltration, and prove its 
completeness in one dimension.

Distance-dependent, pairwise, statistical potentials are
based on the concept that the packing observed in known protein 
structures can be used as a reference for comparing different 
3D models for a protein.
We show that we can filter the list of all interactions in a protein to
generate a much smaller subset of pairs that retains most of the 
structural information

We define a new filtration of the Delaunay triangulation of a 
finite set of points in <i>R<sup>d</sup></i>, similar to the alpha shape 
filtration. The new filtration is parameterized by a local scale
parameter instead of the global scale parameter in 
alpha shapes. Since our approach shares many properties with the 
alpha shape filtration and the local scale parameter conforms to 
the local geometry we call it <em>conformal alpha shape filtration</em>. 
The local scale parameter is motivated from applications and previous 
algorithms in surface reconstruction. We show how conformal alpha 
shapes can be used for surface reconstruction of non-uniformly sampled
surfaces, which is not possible with alpha shapes.

In this paper, we initiate a study of shape description and
classification via the application of persistent homology to two
tangential constructions on geometric objects.
The homology of our first construction, the
tangent complex, can distinguish between topologically identical
shapes with different "sharp" features, such as corners. 
To capture "soft" curvature-dependent features, we define a second
complex, the filtered tangent complex, obtained by parametrizing a
family of increasing subcomplexes of the tangent complex. 
Applying persistent homology, we obtain a shape descriptor, called a
barcode, that is a finite union of intervals.
We define a metric over the space of such
intervals, arriving at a continuous invariant that reflects the
geometric properties of shapes.

Our shape descriptor, called a <em>barcode</em>, is based on a blend of
techniques from differential geometry and algebraic topology.
We also provide a metric over the space of barcodes, enabling fast

To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we have implemented our

We study the homology of a filtered <i>d</i>-dimensional
simplicial complex <i>K</i> as a single algebraic entity and
establish a correspondence that 
provides a simple description over fields.
Our analysis enables us to derive a natural
algorithm for computing persistent homology over
an arbitrary field in any dimension.
Our study also implies the lack of a simple 
classification over non-fields.
Instead, we give an algorithm for computing individual
persistent homology groups over an arbitrary PIDs 
in any dimension.

  We formalize a notion of topological simplification within
  the framework of a filtration,
  which is the history of a growing complex.
  We classify a topological change that happens during growth
  as either a feature or noise depending on its life-time
  or persistence within the filtration.

We present fast implementations of a hybrid algorithm 
for reporting box and cube intersections.  Our algorithm initially 
takes a divide-and-conquer approach and switches to simpler
algorithms for low numbers of boxes.  We use our implementations as engines
to solve problems about geometric primitives.  We look at two such problems

<b>Context-Free Language Induction by Evolution of Deterministic

AAAI Fall Symposium</a>.

<br>
<br>
The process of learning often consists of Inductive Inference, making
generalizations from samples. The problem here is finding generalizations
(Grammars) for Formal Languages from finite sets of positive and negative
sample sentences. The focus of this paper is on Context-Free Languages
(CFL's) as defined by Context-Free Grammars (CFG's), some of which are
accepted by Deterministic Push-Down Automata (D-PDA). This paper describes
a meta-language for constructing D-PDA's. This language is then combined
with Genetic Programming to evolve D-PDA's which accept languages. The
technique is illustrated with two favorite CFL's.
