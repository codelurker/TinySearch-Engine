In this paper, we introduce Authenticated Streamwise On-line

<b>Abstract:</b>
In Blockwise On-line Encryption, encryption and decryption
return an output block as soon as the next input block is received.
In this paper, we introduce Authenticated Streamwise On-line
Encryption (ASOE), which operates on plaintexts and ciphertexts as
streams of arbitrary length (as opposed to fixed-sized blocks),
and thus significantly reduces message expansion and end-to-end
latency.  Also, ASOE provides data authenticity as an option.
ASOE can therefore be used to efficiently secure
resource-constrained communications with real-time requirements such
as those in the electric power grid and wireless sensor networks.
</P><P>
  We investigate and formalize ASOE's strongest achievable notion of
security, and present a construction that is secure under that notion.
An instantiation of our construction incurs zero end-to-end
latency due to buffering and only 48 bytes of message expansion,
regardless of the plaintext-size.
