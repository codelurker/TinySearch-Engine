   If you were using a Java-enabled browser,
   you would see an animated scrolling text sign that looks like this:

<H3>About LED Sign V2.7</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is the newest version of LED Sign.  This will probably the
last release of LED Sign for a while.  Version 2.7 is basically a
"performanced enhanced" version of 2.5.  V2.7 will draw the sign
to the screen quicker, thus producing a "quicker" content feed.
However, it will only be a blank sign until the font and script
have completed downloading.  Also in V2.7 is a more complete
error/warning notification.  If the sign does not load, most
likely an error and discription of what is causing the error will
be printed to the java console.  Also check the java console for
any runtime warnings.

<P>
Also, by popular demand, LED Sign V2.7 supports frame targets.
To specify a frame target just append the target name to the end
of the url, separating the url and target by a comma (','). ie:

<FONT COLOR=#FF0000> <H3>* Support Notice *</H3></FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As of the release of LED Sign V2.7, I will no longer provide
technical support for LED Sign due to time contraints and the
amount of mail that I receive asking for technical support.  So
please do not write me asking how to set it up, how to write a
script, or about a problem you are having.  I feel that I have
provided a fairly complete set of documentation, much more than
you will find with other java applets.  If you do write to me
asking for help, you will have only wasted your time and mine, as
I will delete the mail.  I really wish I could provide support
for LED Sign, but I do not have the time with my college
graduation soon approaching, among other things.  I appreciate
your understanding.

<P>
If you have questions about how to set up an applet, check the
java site at http://www.javasoft.com/.  If you have other
problems, I would suggest checking the usenet newsgroup
comp.lang.java.

<P>
I will continue to improve LED Sign so if you have any bug
reports or suggestions, please let me know.

<H3>Usability</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This applet was designed to be "user friendly".  Everything you see
the sign displaying is run entirely by a script.  LED Sign will
provide errors and warnings in the Java console of netscape to
help make the setup easier and quicker.

<H3>Flexibility</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The LED applet also has a large amount of flexibility.  The size, size
of border, color of border, size of the LED's, and even the font that
the sign uses are all configurable.  The size and border parameters
can be easily set in the applet "command line" in the HTML.  The font
is specified by a data file that contains the shape for each letter.
The font data file can have as many or few characters as needed.  If a
character is used in the message but is not in the font data file,
then it will be substituted by a space.

<P>
<B>Note:</B> If you are upgrading from LED Sign V2.5 or earlier,
you will notice that there is a new parameter, "ht".  This is to
specify the height of the sign in LED's and must be the same as
the height of the font you are using.  If the "ht" parameter is
not specified or incorrect, you will get an error or warning in
the java console.  See the
<A HREF="options.html">configurability</A> page for more info.

<P>
If you are running Win95/NT you might need
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.winzip.com/winzip/winzip95.exe">WinZip95 6.0a</A>
to unzip and untar the archive.  WinZip will retain the long filenames
which are needed for the applet to work.
