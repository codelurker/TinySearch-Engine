<b>Abstract:</b>
I have always been frustrated with the length of time necessary to 
notate a piece of music. Computers have simplified so many other 
aspects of our lives, it seems that they should be able to simplify 
this task as well.  In fact, there are already two distinct ways that 
engineers have attempted to attack this problem.  The first analyzes 
the waveform generated by microphone input and relies on Fourier 
Analysis and other similar methods.  The other examines the analog 
signal generated by a electric guitar-like pickup placed beneath the 
strings. The method used by Fastab relies much less on the musical 
properties of an instrument.  Instead, Fastab records where and when 
the fingers and pick contact the instrument using digital electronics 
and microprocessor technology.  Fastab provides a solution to the 
pitch to notation problem which is cheaper and more accurate than any 
other device available today.
