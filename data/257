These are my notes on James B. Fraleigh's excellent book on abstract
algebra, 
<a href = "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201763907/ref=lpr_g_1/103-8609748-5069422?v=glance&s=books">A
 First Course in Abstract Algebra</a>.
My notes are on the fourth edition, however (the latest being the 7th
edition.)  They are almost complete, and at 44 pages, quite extensive.

This is a proposal I wrote for a project as a graduate student.
For various reasons, I didn't work on it.  
Others have worked on variants of this approach since then.

<b>Survey of Results on Minimal Triangulations.  May 1998</b>

For any closed compact 2-manifold, there is a finite number of 
<em>minimal (irreducible)</em> triangulations.  Therefore, we may obtain any 
triangulation of  a surface by splitting vertices of a minimal 
triangulation of the surface.  
The number of vertices in these minimal triangulations is linear in the 
genus of the underlying surface.

<b>The Monty Hall Problem.  January 1998</b>

This is a short report about the infamous ``Monty Hall Problem.''  
The report contains two solutions to the problem:  an analytic and
a numerical one.  The analytic solution uses probability theory
and corresponds to a mathematician's point of view in solving problems.
The numerical solution simulates the problem on a large scale to 
arrive at the solution and therefore corresponds to a computer
scientist's point of view.
