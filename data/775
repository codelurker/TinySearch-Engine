  Quantum multiparty communication complexity and circuit lower bounds</b></p>

  <p> We define a quantum analog of the classical communication
  complexity model of the "Number on the forehead". We describe a
  connection to circuit depth lower bounds and reduce a classical
  question on the power of the class ACC_0  to a  question about a
  quantum communication lower bound in the above model.  Moreover, we
  show an exponential separation for a total function between classical
  and quantum communication in this model. </p>

  How to Influence Noncooperative, Selfish Agents</b></p>

  <p> The societal value of a distribution of finite resources is
  frequently measured in terms of of aggregate utility.  Decisions,
  however, are frequently controlled by noncooperative agents who try to
  maximize their own private utility.  Papadimitriou coined the term
  "price of anarchy" to refer to the ratio of social utility achieved by
  selfish agents versus the social optimal. </p>

  <p> In network routing games, the price of anarchy can be arbitrarily
  bad.  We review these results, and then describe some solutions to
  prevent this bad outcome.  These include charging users for network
  use; and managing a small portion of traffic wisely.  Some of these
  results carry over to more general congestion games. </p>

  Approximating Shortest Paths with Purely Additive Spanners</b></p>

  <p> An additive k-spanner of a graph is a subgraph whose distance
  metric approximates that of the original graph to within an additive
  error of k. (Graphs are undirected and unweighted).   It is known that
  every graph contains an additive 2-spanner with  O(n^{3/2}) edges and
  that this bound is tight.  Until the present work no other additive
  spanners were known and their existence was very much in doubt. </p>

  <p> In this talk I'll discuss a completely new approach to computing
  spanners based on an economics inspired view of the problem.  Our
  primary result is that every graph contains an additive 6-spanner with
  O(n^{4/3}) edges.  The same method is used to prove several lesser
  results. </p>

  Virtual Transactional Memory</b></p> 


  <p> Computer architecture is about to undergo, if not another
  revolution, then a vigorous shaking-up.  The major chip manufacturers
  have, for the time being, simply given up trying to make processors
  run faster. Instead, they have recently started shipping "multicore"
  architectures in which multiple processors (cores) communicate
  directly through shared hardware caches, providing increased
  concurrency instead of increased clock speed. </p>

  <p> Because conventional lock-based synchronization has well-known
  limitations, a number of researchers have investigated hardware
  support for non-blocking transactions. Preliminary results suggest
  that such "hardware transactional memory" can achieve high
  performance while avoiding many of the limitations of lock-based
  mechanisms. </p>

  <p> Nevertheless, current hardware proposals require programmers to be
  aware of platform-specific resource limitations such as buffer sizes,
  scheduling quanta, as well as events such as page faults, and process
  migrations. These constraints are unacceptable if transactional memory
  is to become widely used. </p>

  <p> This talk describes Virtual Transactional Memory (VTM), a
  user-transparent system that shields the programmer from
  platform-specific resource limitations in much the same way that
  virtual memory shields the programmer from the limitations of physical
  memory. </p>

  Secure Network Coding via Filtered Secret Sharing</b></p>

  <p> We study the problem of using a multicast network code to transmit
  information securely in the presence of a "wire-tap" adversary who can
  eavesdrop on a bounded number of network edges.  We establish a close
  connection between secure linear network coding and a new variant of
  the secret sharing problem, which we call "filtered secret sharing."
  Using this connection, we establish new trade-offs between security,
  capacity, and bandwidth of secure linear network coding schemes. </p>

  <p> Our positive results show that by giving up a small amount of
  capacity, it is possible to dramatically reduce the bandwidth
  requirements of secure linear network coding.  Our negative results
  show that within the framework we consider, unless capacity is
  relaxed, the bandwidth requirements can be prohibitively high.  These
  results are obtained by showing that the problem of making a linear
  network code secure is equivalent to the problem of finding a linear
  error-correcting code with certain generalized distance properties.

  <p> Joint work with Jon Feldman, Tal Malkin and Rocco Servedio. </p>
