  The Bin-Covering Technique for Thresholding Random Geometric Graph
  Properties</b></p>

  We study the emerging phenomenon of ad hoc, sensor-based communication
  networks. The communication is modeled by the random geometric  graph
  model G(n,r,l) where n points randomly placed within [0,l]<sup>d</sup>
  form the nodes, and any two nodes that correspond to points at most
  distance r away from each other are connected.  We study fundamental
  properties of G(n,r,l) of interest: connectivity, coverage, and
  routing-stretch. Our main contribution is a simple analysis technique we
  call <em>bin-covering</em> that we apply uniformly to get <em> first
  known, (asymptotically) tight </em> thresholds for each of these
  properties. Typically, in the past, random geometric graph analyses
  involved sophisticated methods from continuum percolation theory; on
  contrast, our bin-covering approach is discrete and very simple, yet it
  gives us tight threshold bounds. The technique also yields algorithmic
  benefits as illustrated by a simple local routing algorithm for finding
  paths with low stretch. Our specific results should also prove
  interesting to the networking community that has seen a recent increase
  in the study of geometric random graphs motivated by engineering ad hoc
  networks.
