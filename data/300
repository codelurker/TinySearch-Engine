<b> The obelisk of Thutmose I (Karnak Temple)</b>
<BR>
<p>
This obelisk stands 19.5 meters (64 feet) tall.  It was photographed
from a distance of approximately 40 meters (130 feet) with a
tele-photo lens (400 mm) in five overlapping regions.  These images
were then stitched together and contrast enhanced.  This composite was
then rectified to correct for the tilt of the obelisk relative to the
camera, creating a distortion-free image that was effectively
photographed from infinitely far away.  The final image is shown at
1/32 resolution, with the cartouche shown at 1/2 resolution (<a
href="obelisk/obelisk.jpg">the cartouche at full resolution</a>).
These images were taken with a Kodak DCS PRO 14N digital camera with a
14 megapixel 1:1 CMOS sensor, using a Nikon 80-400 mm lens.

This obelisk was erected by Thutmose I circa 1500 B.C.  Some four
centuries later Ramses IV added columns of inscriptions to either side
of the original central inscriptions.  In turn, Ramses VI modified the
names so that the cartouches could be read as both Ramses IV and VI.
