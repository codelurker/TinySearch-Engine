<h1> Graduate Students:  Expectations, Policies, and Procedures</h1>
<p>

This page is intended to help current graduate students better
understand the expectations of the faculty, and to locate the policies
and procedures they need to get through the M.S. and/or Ph.D programs
here in Computer Science at Dartmouth College. It is organized as follows:
</p><ul>
  <li> <a href="#expectations">Expectations</a> of the faculty
  </li><li> <a href="#resources">Resources</a> that list policies and procedures
  </li><li> <a href="#policies">Policies clarified</a>: our clarification of those policies
  </li><li> <a href="#procedures">Procedures clarified</a>: our clarification of those procedures

</li></ul>
<p></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="expectations">Expectations</h2>

M.S. graduate students are expected to
<ul>
  <li> adhere to the <a href="http://www.Dartmouth.edu/artsci/gradstdy/handbook.html#principles">Honor Principle</a>
       as described in the Dartmouth Graduate Student Handbook.
  </li><li> adhere to the <a href="http://www.Dartmouth.edu/artsci/gradstdy/handbook.html#academicconduct">Student Code of Conduct</a>

       as described in the Dartmouth Graduate Student Handbook.
  </li><li> follow the policies and procedures below.
  </li><li> make good progress toward completion of the degree requirements.
  </li><li> ... (to be completed later)
</li></ul>

Ph.D graduate students are expected to
<ul>
  <li> adhere to the <a href="http://www.Dartmouth.edu/artsci/gradstdy/handbook.html#principles">Honor Principle</a>

       as described in the Dartmouth Graduate Student Handbook.
  </li><li> adhere to the <a href="http://www.Dartmouth.edu/artsci/gradstdy/handbook.html#academicconduct">Student Code of Conduct</a>
       as described in the Dartmouth Graduate Student Handbook.
  </li><li> follow the policies and procedures below.
  </li><li> make good progress toward completion of the degree requirements.
       Full-time Ph.D students are required to complete their
       RPE by the end of Spring of their second year,
       and are expected to complete their thesis proposal by the end of Spring
       of their third year.  The typical full-time Ph.D student
       completes their degree in 5&nbsp;(+/-&nbsp;1) years.
  </li><li> present their work in the graduate-student seminar series,
       approximately once per year.
       Thesis proposals and defenses count.
  </li><li> attend a large proportion of the graduate-student seminars and
       departmental colloquia.
  </li><li> perform any T.A. duties thoroughly and responsibly,
       in consultation with the course professor.  A T.A. is expected to
       put in approximately 20 hours per week on those duties.
  </li><li> contribute positively to the department, e.g., serve on committees,
       organize student seminars, install and maintain 'contrib' software,
       and so forth.

</li></ul>

The department reviews the progress of all students every spring,
based on a report provided by them and augmented by their advisor.
The department provides feedback to every student.   Students not
making good progress are warned by the department and will be
re-evaluated six months later.  Students continuing to make little
progress will be dismissed from the program.

<hr>

<h2 id="resources">Key resources</h2>

Dartmouth's policies are listed in the ORC (<em>Organizations,
Regulations and Courses</em>) and in the <a href="http://www.Dartmouth.edu/artsci/gradstdy/handbook.html"><em>Graduate
Student Handbook</em></a>.  Rather than reproducing that material
here, we refer students directly to the most recent edition of the
ORC. In particular, please see the sections on
<ul>
  <li> general Dartmouth rules about graduate study,
  </li><li> additional rules for Computer Science,
  </li><li> academic matters

</li></ul>

Below we add to and clarify the policies and procedures.  Wherever
those, or other, college publications are in conflict with any of the
items below, the official publication should be considered correct.
<p>

Questions, comments, and suggestions are welcome!  Please send them
either to the current advisor to Ph.D students or the current advisor
to M.S. students.

</p><hr>

<h2 id="policies">Policies</h2>

<h3>Requirements for the Ph.D degree</h3>

The requirements are listed in the ORC, as mentioned above, in a
section entitled "Requirements for the Doctor's Degree (Ph.D.)" of the
"Computer Science" chapter.  The following list elaborates on the
points listed there.

<ol>
  <li> Yes, you have to be admitted first. (M.S. students should not
       assume that they will be admitted into the Ph.D program after
       completing their M.S., but are encouraged to apply.)
  </li><li> Here it states that you have to take 6 out of 7 core courses.
       [Note: not all graduate courses will be offered every year. In
       particular, 106 (Numerical Analysis) is not taught very often.]
       Plus four topics courses (181-188).  On rare occasions we will
       allow a student to substitute a topics course for one of the core
       courses, when they can demonstrate that they have already taken
       equivalent courses.  Undergraduate courses do not count for graduate
       credit.
  </li><li> We commonly use "quals" or "qualifying exams"
       to mean "written certification examinations".
  </li><li> The faculty voted to add a sentence
       "That is, the student must pass CS 257."
  </li><li> We propose to rewrite this requirement as follows:
       <blockquote>

       Each student must display readiness for research in one area by
       giving a written and oral presentation of their research plan.  This
       thesis proposal will be judged by a faculty committee; the committee
       will be chosen by the student and approved by the advisor to Ph.D
       students, following the same rules used for composition of a Ph.D
       defense committee.
       The presentation will be followed by a question period in which the
       student demonstrates mastery of the relevant area, and defends their
       proposed thesis plan.
       </blockquote>
<!--   This change has been approved by the department faculty on 3/6/2000
       and now goes to College committees for further approval. -->
  </li><li> See ORC for definition of residence.
<!--  <li> We propose to drop this requirement; the faculty so voted on 3/6/2000.
       The proposal now goes to College committees for further approval.-->

<!--   <blockquote>
       Admission to candidacy by a vote of the department faculty
       (regular and adjunct).  The review of each candidate will take into
       account the student's performance on the certification examinations,
       the student's record in courses, and the prospects that a good thesis
       can be written.
       </blockquote>

       We expect that most students will achieve candidacy immediately after
       they have finished their Thesis proposal.
       (The annual review continues, every year,
       regardless of candidacy status.)
 -->
  </li><li> See below about the thesis committee and defense.
</li></ol>

<h3>Thesis committee</h3>

First, let's define two types of people:
<ul>
  <li> <b>Insider:</b> any professor who is formally connected with
       our department as a regular professor, visiting professor, adjunct
       professor, or who is a post-doctoral researcher in the department.
       Check the ORC for the latest official list of faculty, although
       whenever there is a question please ask the Chair (sometimes adjunct
       appointments have been made since the ORC was published).  We attempt
       to keep the list of faculty and post-docs up-to-date on
       the <a href="/people.html">web</a>.

  </li><li> <b>Outsider:</b> any Ph.D that is not an insider,
       and appropriately relevant to the student's research topic.  They
       might be a Dartmouth professor, a professor at another institution, or
       someone in industry.  Certain people with Ph.D equivalents,
       or other degrees (such as M.D.) can also count.
</li></ul>

The determination is made at the time of the event (proposal or defense).

<p>

So, here are the clarifications for the composition of the
M.S. and Ph.D thesis committee:
</p><ul>
  <li> <b>Advisor:</b> the advisor must be an insider,
       and normally regular professor in the department.
       The choice of advisor must be approved by the advisor to Ph.D students.

  </li><li> As mentioned in the Handbook, the Ph.D thesis committee should
       have at least three people from the department, and at least
       one from outside the department.  That is, at least four people, with
       &gt;=3 insiders and &gt;=1 outsider.

  </li><li> The M.S. committee is at least three people, at most one of
       which may be an outsider.

  </li><li> The student's dissertation advisor should approve the committee
       composition.
       Well before a Ph.D defense, the dean of graduate studies must
       also approve the committee (this is a College requirement).

  </li><li> The committee for the defense is often, though not necessarily,
       the same as the committee used for the proposal.  Because of the
       amount of time elapsing from proposal to defense it's not unusual for
       the committee to need changing.  The proposal committee should follow
       the same rules of composition, but need not be approved by the dean.


</li></ul>

<h3>Thesis proposal</h3>

<ul>
  <li> See procedure for announcing your public defense.
</li></ul>

<h3>Thesis defense</h3>

<ul>

  <li> Each February the Graduate Studies office sends a memo defining
       the deadline for the final date for submitting theses; typically the
       date is the Friday that is nine days prior to Commencement.
       You must have completed all requirements, and a lot of paperwork, by
       that date (check with them).

  </li><li> Work backward from the dissertation deadline to choose a date
       for your defense, in consultation with your advisor and your committee.
       A good rule of thumb is to provide the complete dissertation to your
       committee 2-4 weeks prior to the defense, and allow yourself
       at least 2 weeks after the defense to handle any necessary revisions.

  </li><li> See procedure for announcing your public defense.

</li></ul>

<h3>Grades</h3>

We grade all courses, including research (CS297-299) and teaching
assistance (CS257) on the HP/P/LP/NC scale mentioned in the ORC and
the Handbook.  Note in particular that the Handbook lists some serious
consequences of getting a single NC or two LPs.

<h3>Vacations</h3>

During any year in which they receive compensation from Dartmouth,
regardless of the source of those funds, graduate students are
committed to be in residence for a period of twelve months commencing
one week before fall-term registration.  Vacation time, including
official holidays, should not exceed a total of one month per year and
the time(s) should be mutually agreeable to the student and the
research advisor.  During the summer(s) students are expected to
perform their thesis research, unless they are off Dartmouth funding
(e.g., for internship in industry).  Students should obtain written
permission from their advisor, in advance, for any expected absences
of greater than one month per year.

<p>
</p><hr>

<h2 id="procedures">Procedures</h2>

<h3>Courses</h3>

<ul>
  <li> Full-time students should register for three credits each term.
       If you plan to register for fewer than three actual courses, fill out
       the three credits with the appropriate choice of
       CS&nbsp;257, 297, 298, or 299,
       with the consent of your research advisor.
</li></ul>

<h3>Thesis proposal and defense</h3>

<ul>
  <li> The oral proposal and defense are public events and
       should be announced to the public, using our normal
       colloquium-announcement procedures, at least one week prior to the
       event.  It is the responsibility of the student, in consultation
       with the student's committee, to arrange the date,
       time, and place, and to inform the department staff
       so that an announcement can be made.
</li></ul>

<h3>Summer funding</h3>

<ul>
  <li> Ph.D students on Dartmouth Fellowship (DF) for a given year are normally
       on the fellowship for Fall, Winter, and Spring terms.  We strongly
       encourage students to work with a professor on research during the
       summer term, and are happy to provide DF students with funding for that
       purpose, assuming sufficient funding is available.
  </li><li> Summer DF funding is usually available to those who want it.
       In any case, if you would like summer funding, please
       contact the advisor to Ph.D students.  The advisor will send out
       a reminder to all Ph.D students in early spring term, asking students
       who want summer funding to explicitly request it, to identify the
       professor with whom they plan to work, and to briefly describe their
       project (a paragraph will do).  We ask for explicit requests so that
       we can budget appropriately for the summer, and identify early whether
       all students wanting funding, can receive funding.
  </li><li> Note that you may be asked to T.A. a course in the summer, as with
       any other DF term.
  </li><li> Often students find research internships in industry to be a valuable
       experience, whether in summer or in any other term.
       We encourage you to talk with your advisor, or the
       advisor to Ph.D students, about this possibility.
