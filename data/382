<h3>Laboratory Access:</h3>
In order to obtain access to Sudikoff after hours, and to get into
Sudikoff's Lab 001, you will need to have your Dartmouth ID card activated
for the appropriate access.
<p>
To do this,
complete the online
<a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/internal/">Sudikoff Access Form</a>.
<p>
Keep in mind that it may take 24 hours for access to be activated,

You will also require a computer account on the CS Linux machines.
Contact Chris McDonald, via email, informing him of your prefered (new)
account name.
<p>
Please note that the exterior doors of Sudikoff are automatically locked
after 6:00pm weekdays, and also every weekend and holiday. In addition,
the laboratory doors are locked at all times. You will need your access
card to pass through locked doors.

<h3>Non-Recording Option:</h3>
Because CS23 involves teamwork, and has a significant workload, the
non-recording option is not available for this course.

<h3>Students with disabilities:</h3>
Any student with a documented disability needing academic adjustments or
accommodations is requested to speak with Chris McDonald
by the end of the second week of the term.
All discussions will remain confidential, although the
Student Disabilities Coordinator may be consulted to verify the
documentation of the disability.
