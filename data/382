Rockmore" WIDTH="78" HEIGHT="123" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10" BORDER="0" ALIGN="left"><P ALIGN="left">The name Jackson Pollock brings to mind images of energy, movement, even chaos.The large canvases he created are a riot of dripped and splattered paint, anapparent explosion of motion frozen in time and space. He was the embodiment of"action painting" and one of the great and original figures of abstractexpressionism.</P><P ALIGN="left">Like many, I thought of Pollock as the born artist, someone whose thoughts,emotions and subconscious simply transferred directly to the tip of hispaintbrush. Hans Naumuth filmed Pollock as he created one of his energized dripcanvases; we aft him moving like a dancer, tossing, teasing, twirling paint in analmost unconscious but considered way.</P><P ALIGN="left">But Pollock was absolutely not a born artist. In fact, the overwhelming consensusis that he had almost no innate talent. What Pollock did have was a fierce desireto be an artist. So, Pollock put in years and years of practice.</P><P ALIGN="left">He tried out all sorts of media, including sculpture and metalworking, but itseems he always returned to drawing. He apprenticed to Thomas Hart Benton, arealist and geometric reductionist. When, several years ago, the MetropolitanMuseum of Art held an exhibit of Pollock's notebooks, they were not pages andpages of dripped paint and squiggly lines but, rather, study after study,imitations of El Greco, copies of magazine covers ... evidence of long hours spenttrying to master the techniques of line and shading.</P><P ALIGN="left">Like many of the abstract expressionists, Pollock was familiar with Jungiantheories of the subconscious and for some time was an advocate of automatism andautomatic writing; he aimed to paint or draw "free of the dictates of consciousmanipulation."  Yet the unconscious must draw from somewhere. These images do notspring up simply from our gray matter, but rather from some well of experience,emotion and even technique. As the pen, pencil or brush races across the canvas,seemingly unguided by direct thought, the motion must draw from some familiar,natural, unblocked and deeply remembered activity: the practice.</P><P ALIGN="left">Much of the same is true in mathematics. While for various reasons many of uslike to believe in the myth of the born mathematician and mathematically gifted,in fact, for most of us, mathematical skill is to a degree an acquired talent:pages and pages of sums; then multiplication tables, algebraic manipulations,geometric formulas; and depending on how far our studies take us, integrals,matrix operations and solving differential equations. Problem set after problemset, example after example ... until finally one day, the mechanics of it allrecede into the background and	our minds, our creativity, our inspiration areset free and given the tools to express themselves. Now we can design beautifulhouse, plane or graphics program, now we can explain that economy or diseaseresponse. Our hearts will choose the music we want to hear, and mathematics willhelp us dance to it.</P><P ALIGN="left">I think of these parallels as I look over Pollock made during a 1936 visit toDartmouth with his brother Sande and other artists to see the (then) recentlycompleted Orozco mural cycle, "Epic of American Civilization." The sketches seeminspired by the panel "Gods of the Modern World," which consists of five ghoulishacademics bearing witness to the "birth" of a skull from a skeletal figure wholies supine, surrounded by specimen jars and books.</P><P ALIGN="left">The sketches remind me that academics, science with out inspiration or magic, isa lifeless exercise. Pollock's drawings ... the delicate lines of bones,skeletons and ghosts ... belie the hours of academic drawing exercises, but ofcourse are much more than that. They are a synthesis of his perspiration andinspiration. All that homework gave him a way to channel his ferocious desire tobe an artist into being an artist.</P><I>Daniel N.
