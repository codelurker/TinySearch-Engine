Theory Reading Group - Winter 2006
<br>
</b></center>
</font>

<blockquote> <p> Welcome to the Theory Reading Group at Dartmouth's CS
Department! We have vigorous, exciting discussions/presentations on
recent research in Theoretical CS, accompanied by choice snacks. We meet
on Wednesdays 4:30-5:30 in Sudikoff 114. Everyone is welcome; email
"theory" at "cs" if you'd like to join the discussion. 

In this term, we will primarily investigate the 
computational aspect of game theory. 

<p>
<h3>Winter 2006 Schedule </h3>

<p>

<p> <b>Jan 18, 2006 (Chien-Chung)</b> 
<ul> 
<li> 
We will start with the elementary materials of 
game thoery in the first week. The following link is the  
slides of the game theory course taught by 
<a href="www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns">Mike Kearns </a> at Upenn. 
Chien-Chung is going to present. <a href="Papers/nips.pdf">Basics of Game Theory</a> 
</ul><p>

<p> <b>Jan 25, 2006 (David Wagner)</b>
<ul>
<li> David Wagner will present a very important technique 
in linear programming: primal-dual algorithm. If you have the 
book <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486402584/qid=1137875385/sr=8-2/ref=pd_bbs_2/103-7425715-9312636?n=507846&s=books&v=glance">
Combinatorial Optimization</a> written by Papadimitriou and Steiglitz, 
you can read Chapter~2 and Theorem~3.1 to get a rough idea what he is 
going to talk about. 
</ul><p>


<p> <b>Feb 1, 2006 (Joshua Brody)</b>
<ul>
<li> The original 
speaker David Wagner could not come to the reading group. 
So Joshua Brody give us an improvised talk on his research 
on the ``odd'' perfect number (if such a thing exists). 

</ul><p>

<p> <b>Feb 8, 2006</b>
<ul>
<li> Lisa Fleischer gives a talk about her work on market equilibrium. 

</ul><p>

<p> <b>Feb 15, 2006 (Khanh Do Ba)</b>
<ul>
<li> Khanh presents the FOCS 2005 paper: 
<a href="Papers/akv-2playergames.pdf">On the Complexity of Two-PlayerWin-Lose Games</a>. 

</ul><p>
