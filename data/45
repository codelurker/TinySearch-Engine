<td>The Dartmouth Computer Science Research Symposium is an annual exhibition
conducted by the Department of Computer Science at Dartmouth College. The main objectives are to 
provide a means of communicating research
interests and goals to not only fellow department members, but to the greater
Dartmouth community as well. Hence, we welcome participation by students and faculty members who are not part of the department but are interested in applications and research in computer science. Students and faculty are given an opportunity
to present their research in a professional
environment, either in the form of talks, or in a comprehensive poster session, or as demonstrations of working models.</td>
