<META NAME="abstract" CONTENT="Dartmouth's Greenpass project seeks to provide strong access control
to a wireless network while simultaneously providing flexible guest
access; to do so, it augments the Wi-Fi Alliance's existing WPA
standard, which offers sufficiently strong user authentication and
access control, with authorization based on SPKI certificates.  SPKI
allows certain local users to delegate network access to guests by
issuing certificates that state, in essence, "he should get access
because I said it's okay."  The Greenpass RADIUS server described in
Kim's thesis [55] performs an authorization check based on such
statements so that guests can obtain network access without requiring
a busy network administrator to set up new accounts in a centralized
database.  To our knowledge, Greenpass is the first working
delegation-based solution to Wi-Fi access control.
   My thesis describes the Greenpass client tools, which allow a guest
to introduce himself to a delegator and allow the delegator to issue a
new SPKI certificate to the guest.  The guest does not need custom
client software to introduce himself or to connect to the Wi-Fi
network.  The guest and delegator communicate using a set of Web
applications.  The guest obtains a temporary key pair and X.509
certificate if needed, then sends his public key value to a Web server
we provide.  The delegator looks up her guest's public key and runs a
Java applet that lets her verify her guests' identity using visual
hashing and issue a new SPKI certificate to him.  The guest's new
certificate chain is stored as an HTTP cookie to enable him to "push"
it to an authorization server at a later time.  I also describe how
Greenpass can be extended to control access to a virtual private
network (VPN) and suggest several interesting future research and
development directions that could build on this work.">

<b>Abstract:</b>
Dartmouth's Greenpass project seeks to provide strong access control
to a wireless network while simultaneously providing flexible guest
access; to do so, it augments the Wi-Fi Alliance's existing WPA
standard, which offers sufficiently strong user authentication and
access control, with authorization based on SPKI certificates.  SPKI
allows certain local users to delegate network access to guests by
issuing certificates that state, in essence, "he should get access
because I said it's okay."  The Greenpass RADIUS server described in
Kim's thesis [55] performs an authorization check based on such
statements so that guests can obtain network access without requiring
a busy network administrator to set up new accounts in a centralized
database.  To our knowledge, Greenpass is the first working
delegation-based solution to Wi-Fi access control.
</P><P>
   My thesis describes the Greenpass client tools, which allow a guest
to introduce himself to a delegator and allow the delegator to issue a
new SPKI certificate to the guest.  The guest does not need custom
client software to introduce himself or to connect to the Wi-Fi
network.  The guest and delegator communicate using a set of Web
applications.  The guest obtains a temporary key pair and X.509
certificate if needed, then sends his public key value to a Web server
we provide.  The delegator looks up her guest's public key and runs a
Java applet that lets her verify her guests' identity using visual
hashing and issue a new SPKI certificate to him.  The guest's new
certificate chain is stored as an HTTP cookie to enable him to "push"
it to an authorization server at a later time.  I also describe how
Greenpass can be extended to control access to a virtual private
network (VPN) and suggest several interesting future research and
development directions that could build on this work.
