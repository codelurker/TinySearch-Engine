<p>The lab has a fun group of very talented students working on a
variety of projects from a variety of perspectives.  You can see some
short descriptions of our current <a href="research.html">research
themes</a>, and read some of our <a href="pubs.html">papers</a>.  We
also enjoy the quality of life in the area.  Here are some pictures
from a "typical" group meeting (Xiaoduan leading a discussion of a
paper, on top of nearby Mt. Cardigan): <a
 href="images/cardigan1.jpg">image 1</a>; <a

working with us should refer to the <a
