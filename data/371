<H2> Course description: </H2>
This is a course in what is often called "modern algebra" - the development of the notions of groups, rings, and fields, each of which is some way or  another a generalization of our familiar integers. The course will be both an investigation of the theory as well as the <b> many </b> applications, especially as they arise in signal and image processing. Examples of applications include digital cryptography and error correction.
