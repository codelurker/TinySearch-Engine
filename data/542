<b> Year in Review: 2004 </b>
<p>

I hope that this mail finds you all well.  In what is becoming a
yearly tradition, I write to update you on the happenings of the <a
href="group.html">Image Science Group</a>.  At various times this year, the
group consisted of Lorie Loeb (resident artist/animator/graphics
guru), four Ph.D. students, Kimo Johnson, Siwei Lyu, Alin Popescu, and
Hai Sun, and two undergraduates, Joe and Will Pechter.

<p>

For their senior theses, Joe and Will, working primarily with Lorie,
did some outstanding work on text-to-animation and
speech-to-animation.  Their work earned them high-honors, second place
at the Reid Science Competition, and First Prize (team innovation
category) in the John G. Kemeny Computing Competition, and probably a
few others that I am forgetting.

<p>

Hai Sun succesfully (and brilliantly) defended his Ph.D Thesis on
image-guided neurosurgery.  He is currently in the M.D. program here
at Dartmouth, finishing up the M.D./Ph.D. program.  Just one of
several papers that Hai wrote over this past year is:

<p>

     <dd> Cortical Surface Tracking Using a Stereoscopic Operating Microscope</dd>
     <dd> H. Sun, D.W. Roberts, H. Farid, Z. Wu, A. Hartov and K.D. Paulsen </dd>
     <dd> Neurosurgery, 2004 (in press) </dd>
     <dd> <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/publications/neuro05.html">
          http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/publications/neuro05.html</a> </dd>

<p>

Alin Popescu recently defended his Ph.D. Thesis, entitled "Statistical
Tools for Digital Image Forensics".  This work marks the first
substantive body of work on non-watermark based techniques for
detecting traces of tampering in digital images.  This work was
recently listed in the New York Times Magazine's Year in Ideas as one
of the most important scientific/technological advances of the year:

       http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/press/nytmag04/nytmag04.html </a>
       </dd>

<p>

Two of several papers that Alin wrote are:

<p>

     <dd> Exposing Digital Forgeries by Detecting Traces of Re-sampling </dd>
     <dd> A.C. Popescu and H. Farid </dd>
     <dd> IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 2005 (in press) </dd>

          http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/publications/sp04.html</a> </dd>

<p>

     <dd> Statistical Tools for Digital Forensics </dd>
     <dd> A.C. Popescu and H. Farid </dd>
     <dd> 6th International Workshop on Information Hiding, Toronto, Canada, 2004 </dd>

<p>

Siwei Lyu completed his Ph.D. proposal on a general-purpose
statistical model for natural images with applications to digital
image forensics.  There are at least two very exciting aspects of this
work that have emerged in the past year.  We have used this work to
differentiate between computer generated and photographic images.  I
have testified in several court cases in regard to the application of
this technology to child porn crimes.  (If you recall, the
U.S. Supreme Court ruled, in 2002, that computer generated child porn
is protected under the first amendmant.  As a result, prosecutors are
struggling to prosecute this crime, since the burden of proof is on
the prosecution to prove that the images are real).  More technical
details can be found here:

<p>

     <dd> How Realistic is Photorealistic? </dd>
     <dd> S. Lyu and H. Farid </dd>
     <dd> IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 2005 (in press) </dd>
     <dd> <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/publications/sp05b.html">
          http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/publications/sp05b.html</a> </dd>

<p>

And more legal details are can be found here:

<p>

     <dd> Creating and Detecting Doctored and Virtual Images: Implications
     to The Child Pornography Prevention Act </dd>
     <dd> H. Farid </dd>
     <dd> Technical Report, TR2004-518, Dartmouth College, Computer Science </dd>
     <dd> <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/publications/tr04a.html">
          http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/publications/tr04a.html</a> </dd>

<p>

Siwei also applied his work to the digital authentication of art.
This work appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences:

<p>

     <dd> A Digital Technique for Art Authentication </dd>
     <dd> S. Lyu, D. Rockmore and H. Farid </dd>
     <dd> Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 101(49):17006-17010, 2004 </dd>
     <dd> <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/publications/pnas04.html">
          http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/publications/pnas04.html</a> </dd>

<p>

The popular press picked up on this work and stories appeared in,
among many others, CNN, Boston Globe, Economist, Newsweek, Washington
Post, Wired News, and Yahoo News.  This is very exciting work, and we
plan to pursue several new research areas.

<p>

Kimo Johnson completed some nice work on extending our steganalysis
work (detecting hidden messages) to audio recordings.  These results
will be presentend at the upcoming SPIE conference:

<p>

     <dd> Steganalysis in Recorded Speech </dd>
     <dd> M.K. Johnson, S. Lyu and H. Farid </dd>
     <dd> SPIE Symposium on Electronic Imaging, San Jose, CA, 2005 </dd>
     <dd> <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/publications/spie05.html">
          http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/publications/spie05.html</a> </dd>

<p>

In addition, Kimo has been developing some very nice forensic tools to
detect traces of digital tampering.  This work will nicely complement
the work of Alin and Siwei.

<p>

The CS Department has completed construction on a new wing that has
room for 8 faculty along with student offices and labs.  We have moved
our offices and lab to this new wing.  Our new lab is 900+ sq. ft.
(more than twice the size of our old lab).  This space does not
include separate grad.  offices across the hall from the lab.  We are
currently renovating the space, and, don't worry, I've been talked out
of painting the walls black (I'll send photos once the renovations are
complete).

<p>

And finally, Dartmouth promoted me to Associate Professor with tenure
this year.  Sadly, they also asked me to be Associate Chair of the
department, which means that I am department Chair for 6 months out of
the year.  

<p>

I hope that this email finds you all well and happy.  Please stay in
touch and let me know how things are.
