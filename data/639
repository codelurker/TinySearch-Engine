<b>Abstract:</b>
</P><P>
  Existing client-authentication protocols deployed on the World Wide
Web today are based on conventional distributed systems and fail to
address the problems specific to the application domain.  Some of the
protocols restrict the mobility of the client by equating user
identity to a machine or network address, others depend on sound
password management strategies, and yet others compromise the privacy
of the user by transmitting personal information for authentication.
We introduce a new framework for client-authentication by separating
two goals that current protocols achieve simultaneously:
</P><P>
    1. Maintain persistent sense of identity across different sessions.
</P><P>
    2. Prove facts about the user to the site.
</P><P>
  These problems are independent, in the sense that any protocol for
solving the first problem can be combined with any protocol for
solving the second.  Separation of the two purposes opens up the
possibility of designing systems which balance two conflicting goals,
authentication and anonymity.  We propose a solution to the first
problem, based on the Digital Signature Standard.  The implications of
this framework from the point of view of user privacy are examined.
The paper is concluded with suggestions for integrating the proposed
scheme into the existing WWW architecture.
