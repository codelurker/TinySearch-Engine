In December of 2007, I finished my Ph.D. at the Department of Computer Science at Dartmouth 
College. My advisor was <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~ac"> Amit Chakrabarti</a>. During my first three years at Dartmouth, my research was directed
by <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~sws"> Sean Smith</a>.

<p>
Here is 
<a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/reports/abstracts/TR2003-470/">the
 technical report</a> "Using 
Caching for Browsing Anonymity".
<p>
And here is <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~ashubina/google.html"> 
the proxy</a> that can be used to anonymize your web browsing by using
<a href="http://www.google.com">Google cache</a>. 
<p>
Here is <a href="http://althing.cs.dartmouth.edu/cgi-bin/electme2/master.pl"> 
a demo of an electronic election scheme </a>. The 
<a href="http://dev.hil.unb.ca/Texts/PST/pdf/shubina.pdf"> paper</a> on this
scheme was presented at <a href="http://www.unb.ca/pstnet/pst2004/">
Privacy, Security and Trust 2004 </a>.
<p>
As described <a href="http://althing.cs.dartmouth.edu"> here</a>, I used to run
<a href="http://www.noreply.org/tor-running-routers/#33417B7DE83974EC4BD2248902A185BB981EE5FC">a server</a> in 
<a href="http://tor.freehaven.net"> the 
anonymizing network called Tor</a>, The Onion Routing. At this point, it does
not look as if it would ever be coming back on-line.
<p> Here is the <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/1157n8ph45780633/">paper</a> called "Nearly Private Information Retrieval".
