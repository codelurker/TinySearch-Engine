<META NAME="abstract" CONTENT="  A process causes latency when it performs I/O or communication.
Pipelined processes mitigate latency by concurrently executing
multiple threads--- sequences of operations--- and overlapping
computation, communication, and I/O.  When more than one thread is
ready to run, the scheduler determines which thread in fact runs.
This paper presents techniques for scheduling pipelines, with the
following three findings.
  First, using Linux kernel version 2.6 and the NPTL threads package, we
observe a 3-6% performance improvement over kernel version 2.4 and the
LinuxThreads package.
  Second, we test techniques that both take advantage of prior knowledge
about whether a program is I/O-bound or compute-bound and raise and
lower priorities before the pipeline begins working.  These
techniques, referred to as fixed scheduling, further improve
performance by 5% in the case of the compute-bound columnsort
algorithm.  In the I/O-bound algorithm, fixed scheduling failed to
yield better performance than the default scheduling.
  Third, we test simple, adjusting methods that do not take advantage of
prior knowledge about whether a program in compute-bound or I/O-bound
but rather adjust scheduling as the pipeline progresses.  These
techniques, called adjusting scheduling, fail to yield better
performance than the default scheduling in any of our test cases.
  In addition, we suggest new scheduling calls and other operating-system improvements.">

  A process causes latency when it performs I/O or communication.
Pipelined processes mitigate latency by concurrently executing
multiple threads--- sequences of operations--- and overlapping
computation, communication, and I/O.  When more than one thread is
ready to run, the scheduler determines which thread in fact runs.
This paper presents techniques for scheduling pipelines, with the

  First, using Linux kernel version 2.6 and the NPTL threads package, we
observe a 3-6% performance improvement over kernel version 2.4 and the
LinuxThreads package.

  Second, we test techniques that both take advantage of prior knowledge
about whether a program is I/O-bound or compute-bound and raise and
lower priorities before the pipeline begins working.  These
techniques, referred to as fixed scheduling, further improve
performance by 5% in the case of the compute-bound columnsort
algorithm.  In the I/O-bound algorithm, fixed scheduling failed to
