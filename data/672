<h1><a href="/~cs5/">CS 5, Fall 2008</a><br>
Homework Requirements</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>

The purpose of the homework is to deepen your understanding of the
ideas and techniques developed in the course, to illustrate
applications of these ideas and techniques, and to give you practice
in using them in working programs.

<h2>Assignments</h2>

The course library is the CS 5 web site, 
<!--
which you can access through
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~blackboard/">Blackboard</a>, or you
can dial direct and go to --> <a
href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs5/">http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs5/</a>.
Short assignments and lab assignments will appear there, accessed by
easily recognized links.  Solutions will be placed in the web site
soon after an assignment is due.

<h2>Requirements</h2>

Success and skill in programming require discipline and practice.  The
following requirements for homework embody standards we set for
ourselves and are designed to help you become a better programmer.
The guidelines below refer mainly to the lab assignments, but they can
also guide you in the short assignments.

<h3>Completeness</h3>

<em>Submitted assignments must be complete.</em> Listings must show
the final version of the program; we will not accept handwritten
corrections to the program.  If your program does not work perfectly
by the time it is due, turn in your best effort with a clear
explanation of what works and what does not.  We will have more
respect for you, and you will get a better grade, if you demonstrate
that you understand the merits and limitations of your program rather
than hoping that the defects in a half-working program will go
unnoticed.

<h3>Testing</h3>

<em>You must include well-chosen sample runs of the program to
demonstrate that the program works.</em> Sometimes we will supply test
data.  Other times you must invent it yourself.  The quality of this
test data is important.  Your runs should show that you tested each
special case of your program.  If you leave out some cases, we will
not be sure that your program works.  If you generate lots of random
test data that repeatedly test the same cases, or if the answers are
so complex that they cannot be easily verified, we will suspect that
you do not understand what you are doing.  

<p>

We recommend developing test data (including the correct answers!) 
<em>before</em> you write the program,
and updating it as you develop the program.  This may seem like a strange
idea, but thinking about the test data in advance can be an aid in 
designing the program.  Designing the test data helps you explore the
"problem space" - the types of inputs that your program must handle.
You can then think about how to write a program that can handle the various cases.

<p>

You should make sure to
test boundary cases.  These are the values that separate valid data
from invalid data or one subcase of your program from another subcase.
These boundaries are the places where your program is most likely to
fail.  One boundary case that many programs fail to deal with
correctly is the empty case--namely the case where there is no data at
all to be processed.

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<em>It is as important that programs be readable by people as by
computers.</em> Thus we pay attention to certain aspects of style in
programs that contribute to readability.  There is no absolutely right
style, just as individual styles may vary in writing English.  But you
can obtain some guidance by examining the examples placed in the CS 5
folder.  Style may refer to including appropriate comments in your
programs; to using consistent spacing, indentation and blank lines;
and to choosing consistent names for your classes, variables, and
methods.  Style may also refer, more importantly, to the way that you
structure your program, and this meaning of the term will occupy much
of our attention during the course.

<p>

You should use comments liberally (but not overuse them) to explain
what your program does.  We will be looking for four types of comments:

<ol>

  <li> First, you should have a block of comments at the beginning of
       your program, collectively called the "header."  They should
       contain your name, the date you wrote the program, a description of
       what the program does, and any special instructions on how to use it
       (including any restrictions on its input).  This is also the place to
       credit the original author if you modified or copied someone
       else's code.  In addition, each class and method in your program should
       have a small header of its own to explain what it does and how to use
       it.  Ideally, a person should be able to use a class, or the entire
       program, after reading only its header.  It should not be necessary to
       look at the code.  (Like many ideals, this one is often unattainable.
       Yet you should strive to achieve it.)

       <p>

  <li> The second type of comment explains the use of each variable,
       programmer-defined type, or constant.  These comments are often placed
       on the end of the line containing the definition.  You should choose
       descriptive names for all identifiers (names for variables, constants,
       types, functions, etc.) in your program, and all but the most obvious
       or trivial names should be further described in a comment.

       <p>
       
  <li> The third kind of comment is a "section header"
       within the code.  It usually appears on one or more lines by itself
       with blank lines before and after it, and it gives a high-level
       description of the role that the "paragraph" or
       "section" (a group of consecutive lines that
       accomplish a task) following it plays
       in the program.  If you first write a high-level English description
       of how the program works, the lines in that description become section
       header comments in the program.

       <p>

  <li> The fourth kind of comment explains the role of a particular
       line of code, and it usually appears at the end of that line.  These
       comments are often misused.  They should <em>not</em> be English
       translations of the Java statements. For example, the comment
       <xmp>
       status = 3;  // Set status to 3
       </xmp>
       
       is worse than worthless.  It conveys no additional information
       and clutters up the program.  This kind of comment should instead be a
       higher-level description of how the statement contributes to the
       program or a warning about tricky coding, where more is
       happening than a casual reading might suggest.  A better
       comment would be
       
       <xmp>
       status = 3;  // Indicates that we have found a left-hand monkey wrench
       </xmp>

       This comment explains that <code>3</code> has a special meaning in
       the overall scheme of things.  Such information is vitally important
       to anyone trying to understand how the program works and is not clear
       from the Java code itself.  Of course, it would have been even
       better to have defined a constant
       <code>FOUND_LEFT_HAND_MONKEY_WRENCH</code> to be 3 and to have
       written

       <xmp>
       status = FOUND_LEFT_HAND_MONKEY_WRENCH;
       </xmp>

</ol>

<h3>You should comment your program as you write it</h3>

Believe it or not, it is actually much faster than adding the comments
later.  Having written a lot of code over the years, I know what
I'm talking about.  At the time you write the code, you know what each
line and section is meant to do and the comments come easily.  If you
add them later, you must spend time reconstructing what the code does.
I have had comments save me more than once when someone came and asked
me about code I had written years earlier.  Admittedly, this
situation probably won't occur with CS 5 homeworks, but it's good
practice for your future programs.

<p>

Also, comments are very useful when debugging.  If what the comment
says the code is supposed to do is different from what the code really
does, either the code or the comment needs fixing; in either case,
congratulations--you have found a bug!  <strong>All members of the
course staff reserve the right to refuse to look at uncommented
programs.</strong>

<p>

In fact, if you're really doing it right, <em>you should comment your
program before you write it</em>.  Write the first three types of
comments as an outline of what your code will do once you have written
it.  Because they're in English, you ought to be able to understand
them easily.  Then write the code to match the comments.

<h3>Neatness</h3>

<em>Programs that make good use of indentation for program statements
and tabs to line up comments are much easier to read.</em> Readability
is further improved by judicious use of blank lines to separate blocks
of information and sections of code.  You should also choose a
pleasing way to lay out each control structure and use it
consistently.  The text demonstrates one style.  The class examples
use a slightly different style.  Eclipse supplies its own style, and
using it may be the easiest way to be consistent.  The course staff
will encourage you to write neat code.  We will deduct points for code
that is painful to read.

<p>

Especially important for Java is choosing a consistent mode for using
capital letters.  Because Java is case sensitive, you <em>must</em>
train yourself to use uppercase letters in a consistent way.  We will
expect you to use the standard Java conventions: class names start
with a capital letter, variable and method names start with a
lowercase letter, and names of constants are all uppercase.  For
identifier names that are made up of several words, you should
capitalize each new word (e.g., <code>severalWordVariableName</code>,
<code>MultipleWordClassName</code>).  For multi-word constant names,
use underscores as in the above example of
<code>FOUND_LEFT_HAND_MONKEY_WRENCH</code>.

<h3>Prose</h3>

Exams and some homework assignments will include questions in which
you will need to write some text in English rather than Java.  When
this is the case, be sure to answer these questions.  Answers need not
be typewritten, but they should be well thought out, complete, neat,
legible, and grammatical.  Good English is just as important in
science as it is in nineteenth-century literature.  We set high
standards for ourselves in the use of language and we expect you to do
likewise.  Remember: we cannot appreciate your ideas unless we
understand them, and we will not understand them if they are poorly
communicated.
