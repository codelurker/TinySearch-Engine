<b>Abstract:</b>
Delegation is the process wherein an entity Alice designates 
an entity Bob to speak on her behalf. In password-based security 
systems, delegation is easy: Alice gives Bob her password. 
This is a useful feature, and is used often in the real world. 
</P><P>
  But it's also problematic. When Alice shares her password, 
she must delegate all her permissions, but she may wish to 
delegate a limited set. Also, as we move towards PKI-based 
systems, secret-sharing becomes impractical. This thesis explores 
one solution to these problems. We use proxy certificates in a 
non-standard way so that user Alice can delegate a subset of her 
privileges to user Bob in a secure, decentralized way for web 
applications. 
</P><P>
  We identify how delegation changes the semantics of access 
control, then build a system to demonstrate these possibilities 
in action. An extension on top of Mozilla's Firefox web browser 
allows a user to create and use proxy certificates for delegation, 
and a module on top of the Apache web server accepts multiple 
chains of these certificates. This is done in a modified SSL 
session that should not break current SSL implementations.
