<b>Abstract:</b>
</P><P>
	As wireless networks become more prevalent, a widening array 
of computational resources becomes available to the mobile user. 
Since not all users should have unrestricted access to these 
resources, a method of access control must be devised.  In a 
context-aware environment, context information can be used to 
supplement more conventional password-based access control systems. 
We believe the best way to achieve this is through the use of 
Context-Aware Role-Based Access Control, a model in which permissions 
are assigned to entities called roles, each principal is a member of 
one or more roles, and a role's membership is determined using 
context information.  We designed and implemented RDL 
(Role-Definition Language), a simple, expressive and somewhat 
extensible programming language to facilitate the description of 
roles in terms of context information.
