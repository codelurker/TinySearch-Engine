<b> Year in Review: 2007 </b>
<p>

I hope that this email finds you all well.  I write to update you on
the happenings of the <a href="group.html">Image Science Group</a>.
The group currently consists of Kimo Johnson, Eric Kee, Weihong Wang,
and Jeff Woodward.  Our lab has had a fun and productive year.  Our
main focus continues to be in the area of digital forensics, in which,
thanks to all of you, we have made incredible advances.

It has been an exciting and productive year for <a
href="http://www.mit.edu/~kimo/">Kimo Johnson</a> who
defended his Ph.D. dissertation this summer, was awarded a prestigious
NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship, and will begin a postdoc jointly at MIT
and Adobe Research Labs on January of 2008. Kimo's dissertation is
titled <a
href=http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/publications/mkjthesis07.html>
Lighting and Optical Tools for Image Forensics</a>.

Kimo also gave the keynote lecture at the 6th International Workshop
on Digital Watermarking, where he presented the following paper:

<p>

<dd> <a href=http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/publications/iwdw07.html>Detecting Photographic Composites of People</a> </dd>
<dd> M.K Johnson and H. Farid </dd>
<dd> 6th International Workshop on Digital Watermarking, Guangzhou, China, 2007</dd>

<p>

The emphasis of Kimo's work has been on developing new geometric-based
tools for digital forensics.  Two particularly nice papers on
detecting inconsistencies in lighting are available here:

<dd> <a href=http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/publications/tifs07a.html>Exposing Digital Forgeries in Complex Lighting Environments</a> </dd>
<dd> M.K. Johnson and H. Farid </dd>
<dd> IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 2(3):450-461, 2007 </dd>

<p>

<dd> <a href=http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/publications/ih07.html>Exposing Digital Forgeries Through Specular Highlights on the Eye</a> </dd> 
<dd> M.K. Johnson and H. Farid </dd> 
<dd> 9th International Workshop on Information Hiding, Saint Malo, France, 2007 </dd>

<p>

Kimo (and his wife) was a particularly good sport when I made him pose
for this Star magazine cover (notice him kissing Katie in the circular
inset).

We welcome <a href=http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~erickee>Eric Kee</a>
to our lab.  I met Eric while visiting the CIA.  Eric was at a talk I
gave as part of his work at the Johns Hopkins University Applied
Physics Laboratory.  Eric has spent several years working in digital
forensics, and since coming to Dartmouth has begun some interesting
new work in digital document forensics.

<p>
<HR>
<p>

<a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~whwang/">Weihong Wang</a> has
been doing some excellent work in digital video forensics.  In his two
most recent papers, Weihong has extended Alin Popescu's work in image
forensics to video:

<p>

<dd> <a href=http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/publications/tifs07.html>Exposing Digital Forgeries in Interlaced and De-Interlaced Video</a> </dd> 
<dd> W. Wang and H. Farid </dd> 
<dd> IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 2(3):438-449, 2007 </dd>

<p>

<dd> <a href=http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/publications/acm07.html>Exposing Digital Forgeries in Video by Detecting Duplication</a> </dd> 
<dd> W. Wang and H. Farid </dd> 
<dd> ACM Multimedia and Security Workshop, Dallas, TX, 2007 </dd>

<p>

And Weihong's most recent work will bring some interesting geometric
techniques to digital forensics.  

<p>
<HR>
<p>

Jeff Woodward (Woody) has single-handedly taken all of our digital
forensic work and ported it into a wonderful stand-alone software
package.  We plan to deliver this software to the FBI's forensic lab
in March of 2008.  In addition, Woody and I published a cool technical
report that describes how to enhance low quality video:

<dd> <a href=http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/publications/tr07.html>Video Stabilization and Enhancement</a> </dd> 
<dd> H. Farid and J.B. Woodward </dd> 
<dd> Technical Report, TR2007-605, Dartmouth College, Computer Science </dd>

<p>

<p>

As for me, I continue to split my time between Hanover and Santa Cruz,
CA.  The time in CA is wonderful and productive, and the sunsets
continue to astound me:

<p>

I was also named by Dartmouth as the David T. McLaughlin Distinguished
Professor of Computer Science.  As always, you can find on my web page
copies of our <a href="publications/publications.html">papers</a> and
<a href="publications/publications.html#popularpress">popular
press</a> accounts of our work.

In alumni news, 
<ul>

<li> <a href="http://www.cs.albany.edu/~lsw/">Siwei Lyu</a> has been a
postdoc at NYU for the past few years where he has continued to do
exciting research in the area of natural image statistics.  Siwei
recently accepted a position at SUNY Albany as an Assistant Professor
of Computer Science.

<li> Dave Martin moved to San Jose, CA and is a proud new father.

<li> After several years at Siemens, Senthil Periaswamy has moved to
iCAD in Ohio where he continues to do interesting work in medical

the job.

<li> <a href="http://www.jethrofilms.com">Jethro Rothe-Kushel</a> has
been living in Los Angeles, CA and working in various corners of the
movie industry.  Jethro and I have also been working together on
developing a one-hour drama series based on the general field of
digital forensics.

<li> Kate Sherwin has moved to Austin, TX where she is working in the
field of computational finance.

<li> Hai Sun is at the Oregon Health and Science University as a
