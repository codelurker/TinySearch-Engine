  <p><b>Faith Fich, University of Toronto<br>
  How Difficult is it to Take a Snapshot?</b></p>

  <p> The atomic snapshot object is an important and well-studied
  primitive in distributed computing that allows processes to obtain a
  consistent view of an entire block of shared memory, even if updates
  are being performed concurrently.  This talk will describe
  applications of this object, present some implementations of it from
  registers in both asynchronous and synchronous distributed systems,
  and discuss some recent lower bounds. </p>

  Towards Global Minimum</b></p>

  <p> Global minimization is one of the hardest problems of
  computational mathematics. While several approaches to global
  minimization exist they are heuristic in nature. In this talk I
  concentrate on analytical aspects of minimization of a continuous
  function on a non-bounded set, say F(x). Specifically, I want to
  construct criteria that a found local minimum is the global one. The
  rationale is that (a) there are many algorithms for local
  minimization, such as gradient, Newton, conjugate gradient, (b)
  typically, the problem has few minima and quite likely the found
  minimum is the global one but we are not sure that it is the global
  one.  It is impossible to construct a uniqueness criterion for general
  function, so the choice of a function family is crucial. I work with
  nonlinear least squares where F(x) is the squared distance between
  n-dimensional data vector y and regression function f(x) with n &gt;
  m. </p>

  <p> Discouraging theorem: for any given f there exists y for which the
  least squares problem has multiple local minima; moreover, the Lebegue
  measure of those y is positive. </p>

  <p> We define function level sets that specify different properties of
  the function, from existence of the global minimum to local convexity,
  local unimodality and finally global unimodality. Our global minimum
  criteria use the curvature concept from differential geometry of the
  m-dimensional surface defined by function f(x). Seveal open problems
  are formuated. </p>
