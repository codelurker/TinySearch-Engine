Leave your x-hour open, we will use it a number of times during the term 
to go over homework solutions or for special topics.  Sometimes classes
will be moved to x-hours when I am out of town.

<h2> Prerequisites </h2> 
You should have had a course similar to 
<a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs25"> CS 25 </a> 
which essentially covers the first 26 Chapters of CLRS 
(except Chapter 5). 
<a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs25"> CS 25 </a> teaches you
    how to design and analyze algorithms. It is not a course about 
    implementing algorithms. In CS 105, we will assume that you are
    comfortable with the basic design techniques (e.g. greedy method, divide
    and conquer, dynamic programming) and the mathematical techniques 
    involved in rigorous analysis (e.g. solution of recurrence relations,
    amortized analysis). 
<p> 
You should also have had a course similar to 
<a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs49"> CS 49 </a> 
which covers formal languages, automata theory, and NP-completeness. 
It is particularly important that you have previously 
been introduced to the concept of NP-completeness
and have done some reductions to prove that problems are NP-hard. 

<p> 
If you do not have this background, you should take the appropriate 
undergraduate courses before taking CS105. 
<p> 
Please see me if you have concerns regarding your background. 

<H2> Syllabus</H2>
<ul>
<li> Linear Programming 
<li> Polynomials and the FFT
<li> String Matching Algorithms
<li> Randomized Algorithms
<li> NP-completeness
<li> Approximation Algorithms 
<li> Other topics if we have time. 
</ul> 

<h2> Grades </h2>
The final grade will be determined based on weekly problem sets and
the final take-home exam.  The exam will be roughly  50% of your
grade.  Graduate classes are pass/fail, so I hope that grades will not
be an issue.  The goal of this course is to learn about algorithms.

Homework problems will be graded on the following scale:
<ul>
<li> <b> 5 </b> Outstanding.  Especially elegant or clever solution or
exceptionally clear justification and writeup.  I don't expect to give
out many 5's.
<li> <b> 4 </b>  Good.   The answer is basically correct and clearly presented,
but is not special.
<li> <b> 3 </b>  OK.  Got the basic idea, but either some details are wrong
or the presentation is not clear.
<li> <b> 2 </b> Poor.  Something of value, but below the standard that I
expect.
<li> <b> 1 </b> You tried, but this is not passing work.
</ul>

<h2> Problem Sets </h2>

Problem sets will be given weekly, generally due on Wednesdays.
I encourage you to work on your homework in groups, to discuss
your ideas with me, and to start early.  The problems are best
approached by starting early, thinking about the problems, putting
them away for a day, discussing your ideas with others, etc.  This
process can not take place successfully in the 12 hours prior to when
the homework is due.  You must write up your own solutions and list
anyone with whom you discussed the problem.
<p>

Whenever you present a solution, you should carefully explain how and
why it works.  Examine your justification carefully to make sure that
it is complete and correct.  Please only write down things that you
believe to be correct.  If you are certain you have an incorrect answer,
do not write an obscure answer in an attempt to gain points.  The
purpose is to learn the material, not to gain points.  

<p>
Many of the problems you may be able to solve partially, or for a
special case.  If this is the case, clearly indicate how much of the
problem you are solving and then write that part up carefully.

<p>
It is not necessary that you answer every problem on every problem
set.  However, it is important to have done at least roughly 3/4 of
the problems assigned in the course.


<h2>Late Homeworks </h2>
Homework is due at class time on the due date.  Any exceptions must be
approved by the instructor in advance.

<H2>Honor Code</H2>
<UL>
<LI>All work submitted for credit must be your own.</LI>
<LI>You may discuss the homework problems with your classmates
    and the instructor. You must acknowledge
    the people with whom you discussed your work, and you must write
    up your own solutions.  Any written sources used (apart from the text)
    must also be acknowledged; however, you may <EM>not</EM> consult
    any solutions from previous years' assignments whether they are
    student or faculty generated.</LI>
<LI>Exam problems may only be discussed with the instructor; written
    sources (apart from the text) may not be consulted.  The exams
    are where we find out what you have learned by doing the homework.</LI>
<LI>Please ask if you have any questions about the honor code as it
    applies to CS105.</LI>
</UL>

<h2>Students with Disabilites</h2>
I encourage students
with disabilities, including &quot;invisible&quot; disabilities
such as chronic diseases and learning disabilities, to discuss with
me any appropriate accommodations that I might make on their
behalf.<br>
