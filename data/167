<h2>Course description</h2> 

<p>Computation is vital for modern molecular biology, helping
scientists to model, predict the behaviors of, and control the
molecular machinery of the cell.  This course will study algorithmic
challenges in analyzing biomolecular <i>sequences</i> (what genes
encode an organism, and how are genes related across organisms?),
<i>structures</i> (what do the proteins constructed for these genes
look like, and what does that tell us about their mechanisms?), and
<i>functions</i> (what do these things do, and how do they interact
with each other in doing it?).  The course is application-driven, but
focused on the underlying algorithms and information processing
techniques, employing approaches from search, optimization, pattern
recognition, and so forth.</p>

<p>For a beautiful visualization of the underlying molecules, see
<i>The Inner Life of the Cell</i>, with either <a
href="http://www.studiodaily.com/main/searchlist/6850.html">musical
accompaniment</a> or <a

<p>Here's a fun little <a href="flyer.pdf">flyer</a> for CS types.</p>

<dt>Textbook</dt> 
<dd class="para">None required.  While there are several great
books out there covering some of the material, I haven't found one
that comprehensively introduces the topics we'll cover (biomolecular
sequence, structure, and function) from a computational perspective.
Thus I'll distribute lecture notes and provide references to the
literature.</dd>

<dt>Expected background</dt>
<dd class="para">This is an introductory course targeted at
undergraduate and graduate students in computer science.  A background
in biology is not required, but students should be interested in
catching up quickly on some basic molecular biology and biochemistry.
I also very much welcome and encourage the participation of students
from the life sciences and other related disciplines.  Naturally, a
basic understanding of and interest in computational issues is
expected.  Please contact me to discuss your background and
interests.</dd>

<a name="grading"></a>
<h2>Coursework and grading</h2>

<p>The course seeks to provide broad exposure to some important
algorithmic challenges and approaches in bioinformatics.  The lectures
and readings will provide a fairly general (for a ten-week course)
survey of the field.  Students will then implement and apply some of
the techniques.</p>

<p>Grades are derived from the following:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
  <li>Homeworks: 50%</li>
  <li>Final project: 25%</li>
  <li>Midterm exam: 20%</li>
  <li>Participation: 5%</li>
</ul>

<p>The homeworks are to be done individually; see the honor code
policies below regarding discussion.  We encourage students to work in
groups for the final project.</p>

<p>Homework and project assignments are to be turned in via <a
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~blackboard/">Blackboard</a>
<em>before</em> class on the due date.  Ample time is provided for
each assignment, so in general, late submissions will not be accepted.
Under extenuating circumstances (prolonged illness, death in the
family, etc.), arrangements must be made with the instructor
<em>before</em> the due date.</p>

<p>For exceptional work, it is possible to receive extra credit
points.  Extra credit is tabulated separately from the regular grades
on homework and exams, and is used to adjust final grades after the
final average is computed.  Thus extra credit is always optional, and
not doing any extra credit work will never reduce your final grade,
even if everyone else in the class does a lot of extra credit.</p>

<a name="honor"></a>
<h2>Honor code</h2>

<p>Dartmouth's honor code applies to this course, and academic
misconduct policies will be strictly enforced.  If you have questions,
ask!</p>

<p>You may discuss the homework with other current CS 43/143 students,
but your submitted homework must be entirely your own.  As part of a
discussion, you may show (in person) another student your work.
However, your code and any other solutions you submit must be created,
written/typed, and documented by you alone.  You may not copy anything
directly from another student's work.  For example, copying a portion
of someone else's solution onto a piece of paper would violate the
honor code, even if you eventually turn in a different answer.
Similarly, e-mailing a portion of your code to another student, or
posting it on-line for them to see would violate the honor code.
Although all students must create and type in their own code, you may
help other students debug their programs once you and they have
already written your programs.  We do encourage discussion of homework
assignments between students, subject to these rules.  Note that
discussion between two students will be most useful when both students
have already made serious attempts to solve the problem on their
own.</p>

<p>If you make use of any code that is not your own, you must clearly
attribute the source of the code with clear comments in the code that
you submit.  You do not need to acknowledge discussion with other
students on your submitted work.  Proper respect for copyright laws as
applied to printed materials and software products is subsumed by
Dartmouth College's <a
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/comp/about/policies/">Computing
Policies</a>.</p>

<p>The final project may be conducted individually or in a group.
Here, collaboration is encouraged.  Building on existing code is
acceptable, subject to the above comments regarding attribution.</p>

<p>On the quiz, you may not collaborate with, copy from, or otherwise
share information with anyone.  (You may of course ask questions of
the course staff.)</p>

<a name="access"></a>
<h2>Disabilities</h2>

<p>Students with disabilities enrolled in this course and who may need
disability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to make an
appointment to see the instructor before the end of the second week of
the term. All discussions will remain confidential, although the <a
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~accessibility/">Student Accessibility
Services</a> office may be consulted to discuss appropriate
implementation of any accommodation requested.</p>
