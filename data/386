<h2><a name="maps"> Maps from my Christmas cards</a></h2>
<p>
<b>Ring of Fire.</b>  The great chain of volcanoes is usually depicted
as surrounding the Pacific Ocean.  Here the perspective is
reversed and the volcanoes surround the continents.
<blockquote>
Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein:
For I, saith the Lord, will be unto her a wall of fire round about.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--&nbsp;Zechariah 2:4-5
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Jerusalem Trefoil.</b>  Three circles of different sizes are drawn 
on the globe roughly to encompass each of three continents, with each
circle passing through Jerusalem.  Then the circles are
stretched conformally into trefoil leaves.
<p>
<b>Way to go.</b>  On this map for shepherds and magi a line from any point 
to Bethlehem shows the great-circle direction
to Bethlehem (but not the great circle itself).
Within the inner hemisphere directions are conventional;
north up, east to the right.  Within the outer hemisphere they
are inverted--north down, east still to the right.
Peter McIlroy suggested this
arrangement of the hemispheres, which are usually
presented as two conventionally oriented sheets.

<h3>Conformal polygonal hemispheres</h3>
<b><a href="maps/penta.jpg">Big star.</a></b> Northern and 
southern hemispheres are pentagons.
<p>
<b><a href="maps/hex.jpg">Sea whirled.</a></b> 
Hemispheres are
triangles, with which the plane can be tiled continuously.
The orientation here (hemispheres bounded by 80&deg;E and 100&deg;W;
vertices at 90&deg;S and 30&deg;N) is chosen to display the continuity
of the major oceans. In an extended tiling,
the coastlines of North
America and Eurasia would be trebled like Antarctica's.
<p>
Two decades after the math for conformal polygons was published
(H. A. Schwarz, 1869), conformal square hemispheres
appeared in cartography (C. S. Peirce, 1888),
but triangles came considerably later (O. S. Adams,
1925) and pentagons not for a century
(J. P. Snyder, unpublished).
My <a href="map.tar.gz">map program</a> can draw the 3- through 8-sided members
of this series.
<h2><a name="words">Word squares</a></h2>
<p>These squares, which I found by
exhaustive search in Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, were
nominated as best of their sizes by
the nonpareil word-gamester, Dmitri Borgmann;
see A. Ross Eckler, <em>Making the Alphabet Dance</em>,
St. Martin, 1995.
More squares have been published in 
<a href="http://www.wordways.com"><em>Word Ways</em></a>;
see my <a href="doug.bib">bibliography</a>.
A <a href="squares.c">C program</a> for the search
still exists, simplified from the original, which had to be
contorted to squeeze into a tiny DEC PDP-11.
