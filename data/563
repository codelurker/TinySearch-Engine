<b> The burial chamber of Sennedjem </b>
<BR>
<p>

Shown to the right are a pair of photographs taken from each end of
Sennedjem's burial chamber.  The extensive distortions are due to the
curved ceiling, the wide-angle lens, and the inherent effects of
perspective projection.  Under these conditions it is nearly
impossible to obtain a complete distortion-free view of the burial
chamber.

<BR><BR>

In order to create a single distortion-free mosaic, we digitally
estimate and remove these distortions.  To see how this works consider
the pair of images of neighboring ceiling panels shown <a
href="sennedjem/senimage2.jpeg"> here</a>. The distortions are
estimated by first specifying the initial (yellow circles) and desired
(red circles) position of several points in the image.  A non-linear
mapping characterizing the distortions is then automatically
estimated.  The distortions are removed by warping the initial image
according to this mapping as shown <a href="sennedjem/senimage2.jpeg">
here</a>.  Where necessary, the aspect ratio is adjusted and
variations in lighting are manually corrected by locally adjusting the
color/lightness.  Finally, neighboring images are combined by manually
overlaying their common parts and removing the overlapping areas.

<BR><BR>

We begin with sixteen photographs with nearly full coverage of
Sennedjem's burial chamber. The distortions in each image are removed
and then seamlessly combined to form a complete and distortion-free
view of the entire burial chamber as shown to the right (at 1/40 resolution).
These images can then be combined with a three-dimensional computer
model of the burial chamber giving an immersive experience of this
chamber's beauty [Quicktime Movies: <a href="sennedjem/senmovie1.qt">
