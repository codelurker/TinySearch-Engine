I received my Ph.D. from the 
<a href="http://www.polito.it">Poilitecnico di Torino</a> in 
<a href="http://security.polito.it">Computer Engineering</a> in March 2007.
<!--
under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://taurus.polito.it/~lioy">
Antonio Lioy</a>.
-->
Following my doctorate, I joined Dartmouth College as a Post-Doctoral 
Research Fellow with the Institute for Security Technology Studies (ISTS).
During my graduate studies, I worked at the
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~pkilab">PKI/Trust Lab</a> at
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu">Dartmouth College</a> for six months
where I contributed to the work of Prof. 
<a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~sws">Sean Smith</a> and his
collaborators.
Before then, I worked for several companies as PKI/Security consultant.
In 1998, I started the <a href="http://www.openca.org">OpenCA project</a>
and I still continue its development and management.
In addition to my Ph.D., I hold a Laurea (equiv. to BS and MS) in 
Computer Engineering from the
<a href="http://www.unimo.it">University of Modena, Italy</a>.

Security is an important aspect of life. Even more when it comes to internet
and <i>Identity Management</i>.
Public Key Infrastructures help in providing an efficient method to issue
digital identities that can be used over public network to secure
communications and data exchange.
My <i>long term goal</i> is to make the deployment of PKIs and usage of
Digital Certificates on a large scale feasable for every day use.
My research has potential impacts on many fields.
The capillary adoption of certificates at every level, i.e. for small
pervasive devices (sensors or mobile phones) or for people (digital IDs
and passports), can stimulate research in the area by rethinking the
principles of PKIs.
<!--
The successful deployment of large PKIs will also raise important questions
in social sciences, e.g., "how will the use of these techologies impact on
the society ?" and "How to improve user awareness about the importance of
using secure communications in a digital world ?".
-->
Moreover adoption of digital certificates and digital identities provided
by governments will allow for new opportunities in eCommerce, Privacy and
Digital Data Management.
</p>
<p>
My <a href="research_activities.shtml">current research</a>
work aims to achieve usable security that uses digital certificates to
simplify key management issues.
Rather than focusing on the definition of new cryptographic algorithms, my
research is aimed to provide simpler and effective trust management.
My short term objective is to make current PKI technology easy to use for
both application developers and users. For this I am working toward the
definition and standardization of a new <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-pala-prqp-00.txt">PKI Resource Discovery Protocol</a>.
Moreover I started several <a href="research_activities.shtml#projects">
projects</a> that serve as frameworks to deploy my research into real
environments.
</p>
<p>
To pursue my long term goal, I will focuse my teaching efforts on providing
students with a global vision about security issues by exposing them to both
technical and non-technical aspects.
I also plan to leverage the interdisciplinary nature of security in order to
collaborate with other departments.
This will stimulate students and collaborators to think about
security and privacy issues as a whole: a complex and comprehensive process.
Moreover the experience acquired in years of consultancy work in the
area allow me to more effectively help students in their curriculum
development.
