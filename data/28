<b>Abstract:</b>
We present the first dynamic universal accumulator that allows (1) the
accumulation of elements in a DDH-hard group G and (2) one who
knows x such that y=g^x has --- or has not --- been
accumulated, where g generates G, to efficiently prove her
knowledge of such x in zero knowledge, and hence without revealing,
e.g., x or y.
</P><P>
  We introduce the Attribute-Based Anonymous Credential
System (ABACS), which allows the verifier to authenticate anonymous
users according to any access control policy expressible as a
formula of possibly negated boolean user attributes. We
construct the system from our accumulator.
