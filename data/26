My email address is of the form <em>lastname</em>  <em>[at]</em> cs <em>[dot]</em> dartmouth <em>[dot]</em>  edu. </bod1>           <p> <bod1>I am a member of the Dartmouth <a  href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~pkilab"> PKI/Trust Lab</a>, which  implements and studies a variety of security-related technologies.</bod1>            <p> <bod1>My current research activities surround access control and  the human factors (both business- and usability-oriented) that  constrain or drive authorization systems. More generally, I like  investigating the intersection of human systems and secure computer  systems. I am also interested in operating systems and networks, and have a passion for discrete math, although I don't get to do much of it these days.</bod1>           <p> <bod1>I am a <a href="http://www.wellesley.edu">Wellesley  College</a> alumna, Class of 2004. As an undergrad I majored in  Computer Science and French. </bod1>     <p> <bod1>When not doing research, I enjoy a variety of activities,  including knitting, preening my pet bird, and generally collecting  hobbies. I am a member of the Dartmouth Council on Computing, and a  few other campus committees and organizations. </bod1>  <p><bod1>One of my favorite activities is working as a mentor for  Dartmouth's Women in Science Program, which I find highly  rewarding. If you have questions about the CS program at Dartmouth,  getting a job or internship in CS, or other questions related to  being a computer scientist, drop me an email or come find me in the  CS department.<bod1>  <p> <bod1>You've certainly heard of <a  href="http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com/">Chuck Norris</a>.
