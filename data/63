<h2>Sergey Bratus</h2>

<p>
I am a <!-- Postdoctoral Research Associate --> Research Assistant
Professor at the Computer Science Department at Dartmouth College. I
am interested in all aspects of Unix security, in particular in Linux
kernel security, detection and reverse engineering of malware
(primarly kernel mode, Linux and Windows), and wireless networking.
I am also interested in visualizations of computer security-related
information. 

<p>
My other interests are in applications of Natural Language Processing 
for better indexing, search and navigation of natural language documents.

<h3>Projects</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://baffle.cs.dartmouth.edu/">Baffle</a> -- active 802.11 
    behavioral fingerprinting.

  <li><a href="http://kerf.cs.dartmouth.edu/">Kerf</a> -- 
    data organization and machine learning techniques for smarter log and packet
    capture browsing, analysis and sharing.

  <li><a href="http://lzfuzz.cs.dartmouth.edu/">LZfuzz</a> -- 
    a simple fuzzer for plain text proprietary protocols, such as 
    those still found in SCADA systems. 
  
  <li><a href="http://windsock.cs.dartmouth.edu/">Windsock</a> -- 
    networks monitoring sensors based on streaming estimation
    of information-theoretic measures.

  <li>While working on Kerf, I developed several
      tools as side projects. A tool for visualizing and browsing 
      Linux Snare and Solaris BSM system call traces 
      is described 
      <a href="http://kerf.cs.dartmouth.edu/files/syscalls.html">here</a>
      (and is freely available upon request).
</ul>  

<h3>Teaching</h3>

This Winter 09 I am teaching <a href="cs108/">CS 108, "Advanced Operating Systems"</a>, based
on OpenSolaris, with some Linux kernel and general hacking thrown in.

<p/>

<p/>
In Spring 05 I taught CS 38,
<i>Computer Security and Privacy</i>. The class materials are here: 
[<a href="http://althing.cs.dartmouth.edu/secref/">CS38 '05 local copy</a>].

<h3>Hacking</h3>
<p>
Recently I published several articles in which I tried to describe
some trends in the hacker learning experience (the so-called
<i>"hacker curriculum"</i>) that distinguish it from the typical
experiences of traditionally trained developers and CS students:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www2.computer.org/portal/web/computingnow/0808/theme/security">
  What Hackers Learn that the Rest of Us Don't: Notes on Hacker Curriculum</a> 
  [<a href="http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MSP.2007.101">DOI</a>],
  [<a href="http://www2.computer.org/cms/Computer.org/ComputingNow/homepage/0808/WhatHackersLearnThatTheRestOfUsDont.pdf">PDF</a>]
  <br>
  I hope to use these observations a basis for larger work on the "hacker
  curriculum" and a <b>bibliography of influential hacker work</b>. You are 
   welcome to send me comments on the  
  <a href="hacker-methodology.pdf">[rough draft]</a>.

Some of my "random" <a href="http://kerf.cs.dartmouth.edu/files/patches/">patches</a> to standard tools
(Etherape, dsniff, fragrouter, tcpflow, tcpreplay, etc., see 
 <a href="http://kerf.cs.dartmouth.edu/files/patches/README.txt">README</a>).   

<h3>Personal</h3>

<p>
I received my undergraduate education at the 
<i>Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology</i> (aka Moscow Phystech), 
and my Ph.D. at <i>Northeastern University</i> (1999). 
Before coming to Dartmouth I worked at <i>BBN Technologies</i> on
statistical learning for text understanding and similar topics.

<!-- <a href="http://www.mipt.ru/eng/">Phystech's webpage</a> has too
many references to its Soviet glories for my comfort, including a
rather servile sounding reference to "the approval of Joseph Stalin
himself". If, gentle reader, you are, like me, the type that looks for
comments in HTML source, you may be interested to know that Phystech
was founded with the explicit purpose of providing scientists for the
Soviet nuclear and ballistic missiles efforts, started out under the
direct supervision of Lavrentii Beria, the last in the line of
Stalin's murderous secret police chiefs, and to this day its division
into departments roughly corresponds to the major subsystems of an
ICBM. While Phystech was run by and produced many excellent
scientists, it was in no way an oasis of scientific freedom in the
Soviet days.  -->
