<h3>Poster Guidelines</h3>

<ul>
<li>Please send an email to <a href="mailto:csrs@cs.dartmouth.edu">csrs@cs.dartmouth.edu</a> with subject line "CSRS poster" to register your poster.  Include the presenter's name and a poster title.</li>

<li>Bring your poster with you to the symposium on Saturday morning.  One of our committee members will be there to check it in.</li>

<li>Presenters will be expected to stand by their posters during the session.</li>

<li>This <a href="MapRoomFAQ.pdf">link</a> is a FAQ about the Evans Map Room, which is located in Baker/Berry library. The Evans Map room will print posters for you, as long as it
is in Powerpoint or PDF. (There are other acceptable formats. Consult
the <a href="MapRoomFAQ.pdf">Map Room FAQ</a> for details.</li>

<li>Posters take a nontrivial amount of time to print. Get your
posters in a few days early to ensure that it can be printed in time for the
conference.</li>

<li>Colloquium posters should be 3 feet by 2 feet. We need this size
requirement to fit the space we're using for the poster session.</li>

<li>Consult the following <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Ewisp/wetterhahn/student_info.html"> website</a>
from our friends in the WISP program for tips on how to make a good
poster. Remember our size requirement is 3 by 2 feet, so ignore the
size on the WISP page.</li>
