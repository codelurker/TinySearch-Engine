Are you looking for solutions to exercises and problems in
<i>Introduction to Algorithms</i>?

<p>

If you are, then see the <a href="#solutions">frequently asked
question and answer</a> below.

<p>

If you request solutions from me, I will not respond.

<hr>

I receive many requests from students who want to work with me as
interns or as graduate students.  I am not taking on any interns or
new graduate students at this time.

<hr>

From July 2004 through June 2008, I was the director of the <a

<h3><i>Introduction to Algorithms</i></h3>

Yes, I am coauthor of <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i>, along with <a
href="http://supertech.csail.mit.edu/~cel">Charles Leiserson</a>, <a
href="http://theory.csail.mit.edu/~rivest">Ron Rivest</a>, and <a
href="http://www.ieor.columbia.edu/~cs2035">Cliff Stein</a>.  Here are
answers to a few frequently asked questions about <i>Introduction to
Algorithms</i>:
<dl>
  <dt> <i>I see that there are two versions of the second edition,
       one published by The MIT Press and one published by McGraw-Hill.
       How do the two versions differ?</i>
  <dd> Other than minor differences in the covers, the book content
       in the two versions is identical.  McGraw-Hill also includes a CD
       (see the next question).
       <p>

  <dt> <i>Are the algorithms in the book implemented in a real programming
       language, rather than just pseudocode?</i>
  <dd> McGraw-Hill now includes with the book a CD containing Java
       implementations of all the algorithms in Parts I-VI.  The CD also
       has Javadoc-generated web pages that document all the classes.
       <p>

  <dt> <a name="errata"></a><i>Where can I find a list of errata?</i>
  <dd> We maintain an <a href="clrs-2e-bugs">errata page</a> that allows
       you to list errors by date, by page, by severity, or by discoverer.
       There is even an incremental update feature, allowing you to list
       only the errors posted since the last date that you asked about.
       <p>

  <dt> <i>How do I report errors?</i>
  <dd> First, please visit the <a href="clrs-2e-bugs">errata page</a>
       to verify that the error has not been reported already.  Once
       you have determined that you have found an unreported error,
       send email to <a
href="mailto:algorithm-bugs@mitpress.mit.edu">algorithm-bugs@mitpress.mit.edu</a>.  We will respond as quickly as possible, often within a day.
       <p>

  <dt> <i>Do you correct errors?</i>
  <dd> Yes.  Each time a new printing is produced, it contains corrections
       to all errors that have been reported by that time.  The <a
       href="clrs-2e-bugs">errata page</a> indicates in which printing
       each error was corrected.
       <p>

  <dt> <i>What is the difference between an edition and a printing?</i>
  <dd> Each edition is a major revision of the book.  The first edition
       of <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i> was published in 1990, and
       the second edition did not appear until 2001.  A printing for a
       given edition occurs when the publisher needs to manufacture more
       copies.  As the answer to the previous question indicates, we
       have been correcting errors in each printing of the second
       edition.  We perturb the pagination as little as possible when
       correcting errors for a new printing.
       <p>

  <dt> <a name="solutions"></a><i>Can I get solutions to exercises and
       problems?</i>       
  <dd> If you are an instructor who has adopted the book for course use,
       yes.  Otherwise, no, and please do not ask me for solutions; I
       will not respond.
       Instructors who have adopted the book for course use can get
       the Instructor's Manual, which has lecture notes and solutions
       to some (but not all) of the exercises and problems.  You'll
       need to contact either The MIT Press (if you are outside the U.S.
       and Canada) or McGraw-Hill (if you are within the U.S. or Canada)
       for passwords to access the manual site and the files.  You cannot
       get the passwords from me or from any of my coauthors.
       <p>

  <dt> <i>How can I typeset pseudocode to make it look like the pseudocode
       in the book?</i>
  <dd> In June 2003, I made available the <code>clrscode</code> package
       for LaTeX2e.  You can download the package and its documentation
       (in either PostScript or PDF) by clicking <a
       href="clrscode">here</a>.  The package is also on the
       <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/clrscode/?filename=macros/latex/contrib/clrscode/&preferredCTAN=tug.ctan.org&action=/tools/filesearch&catstring=macros/latex/contrib/clrscode/">CTAN website</a>.
       <p>

  <dt> <i>Where are the web sites for the book?</i>
  <dd> The MIT Press site is <a
       href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/algorithms">http://mitpress.mit.edu/algorithms</a>.
       The McGraw-Hill site is <a href="http://catalogs.mhhe.com/mhhe/viewProductDetails.do?isbn=0072970545">http://catalogs.mhhe.com/mhhe/viewProductDetails.do?isbn=0072970545</a>,
       and you can find the McGraw-Hill Online Learning Center for the
       book at <a
       href="http://www.introductiontoalgorithms.com">http://www.introductiontoalgorithms.com</a>
       (also <a
       href="http://www.introtoalgorithms.com">http://www.introtoalgorithms.com</a>).
       <p>

  <dt> <i>Are you guys going to produce a third edition?</i>
  <dd> Yes.  Click <a href="CLRS3e">here</a> for more information.

<h3>Miscellaneous Personal Stuff</h3>

My brother-in-law, Tony Pecora, is the first patient in the US to
undergo the Edmonton Protocol for treatment of juvenile diabetes.
Check out his website at <a

<p>

My wife, Nicole, and I took a <a href="bbqtour">Barbecue tour</a> of
the South in August 1998.

<p>

I was the Ice Man for the <a href="http://www.mdbbq.com">Maryland
State Barbecue Championship</a> in 2003, 2004, and 2005.  Here's a <a
href="ICE.jpg">photo</a> from the 2005 contest of me with a
quad-runner full of 40-pound bags of ice.  The photo was taken by the
<a href="http://www.dizzypigbbq.com/">Dizzy Pigs</a>, the 2005 and
2006 Grand Champions.  Even with the megaphone, I was pretty hoarse by
the end of the second day.  The Dizzy Pigs, and all the other
contestants, can explain why.

<p>

In September 1997, Nicole and I finished hiking all 48 of the
4000-foot peaks in the <a
href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/whites/summits_alf.html">White
Mountains</a> of New Hampshire.

Have you ever noticed <a href="bank">something odd about bank deposit
