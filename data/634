<b>Abstract:</b>
The problems of word sense disambiguation and document indexing for
information retrieval have been extensively studied.  It has been
observed that indexing using disambiguated meanings, rather than word
stems, should improve information retrieval results. We present a new
corpus-based algorithm for performing word sense disambiguation. The
algorithm does not need to train on many senses of each word; it uses 
instead the probability that certain concepts will occur together.
That algorithm is then used to index several corpa of documents.  Our
indexing algorithm does not generally outperform the traditional
stem-based tf.idf model.
