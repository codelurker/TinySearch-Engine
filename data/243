<h1>
The SeatPack</h1>
We travel a lot with our kids.&nbsp; Every trip seems to require at least
one layover in a large airport, requiring us to lug three kids, 1-3 car seats,
a diaper bag, and a few other carry-on bags from one gate to another.&nbsp;
Whew! that's a lot to carry.
<p>So I decided to convert the carseats into "back-packs", so that I could
carry the seats hands-free.&nbsp; I often stuff some of the smaller carry-on
bags, coats, sweaters, etc, into one of the seats.&nbsp; It's so much more
comfortable than lugging them around in my arms!

<p>One drawback is that you have to be really careful when you turn around,
lest you bop somebody on the head with the carseat.

I ordered a simple set of back-pack straps from <a href="http://www.campmor.com/">Campmor</a>.&nbsp;
I spent about $30 per seat and got some nice straps, but you could probably
find nearly the same thing at any outdoor gear store, or probably places
like KMart, probably for less money.&nbsp; You don't need anything fancy:
just a <a href="http://www.campmor.com/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/ProductDisplay?prmenbr=226&prrfnbr=9042">pair
of straps</a>, four sets of <a href="http://www.campmor.com/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/ProductDisplay?prmenbr=226&prrfnbr=9168">clevis
pins with split rings</a>, and probably a few washers.&nbsp; (The pins
and rings attach the pack straps to the seat.)&nbsp; I was lucky to find
holes in the seats in just the right places; I needed to add a few washers
to strengthen the connection.&nbsp; I suppose it wouldn't hurt to drill
a hole, if necessary, but I can imagine a seat manufacturer claiming that
voided the warranty.
<p>The straps don't interfere with the seat's usage in the car, so I leave
the straps on all the time, ready to go.

<h2>
Disclaimer</h2>
I would never use this rig to carry my kid on my back.&nbsp; The parts
of the seat to which I attach were not designed for that sort of stress,
so the pins might pull right through.&nbsp; Also, as you can see in the
middle photo, the system depends on the shear stress of the ring, unlike
in most back-pack systems that depend on the shear stress of the pin.&nbsp;
So I'd be afraid of the pin pulling through the plastic hole on the seat,
or the ring shearing through, if there were a lot of weight.&nbsp; If I'm
just carrying a diaper bag, and it fails, so what... but if I'm carrying
a kid, and it fails, I'm in big trouble.
<p>I doubt it would be good for long distances, unless you added some padding
along the back.
<p>It's not really a back-pack in the sense that I can carry big loads.&nbsp;
I guess it's a car seat you can carry on your back.
