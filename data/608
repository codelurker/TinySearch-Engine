<b>Abstract:</b>
Ubiquitous computing promises to integrate computers into our physical
environment, surrounding us with applications that are able to adapt
to our dynamics.  Solar is a software infrastructure designed to
deliver contextual information to these applications.  To serve the
large number and wide variety of context-aware devices envisioned by
ubiquitous computing, Solar must exhibit both high performance and the
ability to interoperate with many computing platforms.  We created a
testing framework to measure the performance of distributed systems
such as Solar, as well as a pluggable data-transfer mechanism to
support the dissemination of information to heterogeneous
applications.  This paper explores the testing framework developed,
analyzes its findings concerning the performance of the current Solar
prototype, presents several optimizations to Solar and their effects,
and finally discusses the design of the pluggable data-transfer
mechanism.
