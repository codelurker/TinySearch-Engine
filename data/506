Brain deformation models have proven to be a powerful tool in
compensating for soft tissue deformation during image-guided
neurosurgery. The accuracy of these models can be improved by
incorporating intraoperative measurements of brain motion. We have
designed and implemented a passive intraoperative stereo vision (iSV)
system capable of estimating the 3-D shape of the surgical scene in
near real-time. The motion of the estimated cortical surface is then
tracked over time. This cortical motion is used to guide a full brain
model, which subsequently updates a preoperative MR volume. We have
found that the iSV system is accurate to within approximately
1mm. Executing on a 1.1 GHz Pentium machine, the 3-D estimation from a
stereo pair of 1024 x 768 resolution images requires approximately 60
seconds of computation. Based on data from representative clinical
cases, we show that stereopsis guidance improves the accuracy of brain
shift compensation both at and below the cortical
surface. Specifically, we report an average error reduction of 3.7mm
relative to the model estimate without using intraoperative data. In
addition, advantages of our iSV system include its fast acquisition
rates, predominantly automated steps, and overall accuracy. These
characteristics allow us to capture other important cortical behavior
such as the tissue resection and the pulsatile motion of the cortical
surface.
