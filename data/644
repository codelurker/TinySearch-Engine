</P><P>
	This thesis presents a system for web-based information
retrieval that supports precise and informative post-query
organization (automated document clustering by topic) to decrease real
search time on the part of the user.  Most existing Information
Retrieval systems depend on the user to perform intelligent, specific
queries with Boolean operators in order to minimize the set of
returned documents.  The user essentially must guess the appropriate
keywords before performing the query.  Other systems use a vector
space model which is more suitable to performing the document
similarity operations which permit hierarchical clustering of returned
documents by topic.  This allows "post query" refinement by the user.
The system we propose is a hybrid beween these two systems,
compatibile with the former, while providing the enhanced document
organization permissable by the latter.
