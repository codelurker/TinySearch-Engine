<b>Help:</b>
</big><br>
<p>
To get help, stop by or send email. You can also
set up an appointment for other times. 
<p>
If you try stopping by, note that I do have office hours.  If you stop by at some other point, I might gently suggest returning during office hours, if I'm swamped with something.

<b>Public Lab Space:</b>
</big><br>
<p>
There is public lab space available in Sudikoff Room 001 for students
enrolled in computer science courses who need Linux machines (which you do).
You will need to arrange ID-card access to get 
into Sudikoff 001 and to get into the building in the evenings
and on weekends. If you don't have that already, you should see
Kelly Clark in 101 Sudikoff.  <b>Don't dawdle; it can take 24 hours
to turn access on.</b>

<b>Late Assignments:</b>
</big><br>
<p>
Assignments are due when they are due; 
extensions are not fair to the students sufficiently 
diligent to complete their assignments on time.
<p>
If you have a pressing need for a delay, I might listen.
Then again, I might not.
<p>
Plan accordingly.
<p>
I may otherwise apply 
a "5% off per hour" late policy both to 
the written homework and to the programming projects.

<b>Honor Code:</b>
</big><br>
<p>
The Dartmouth Honor
Code applies to your conduct in this course.  In particular, all
work submitted for credit must be your own.
You may discuss your
homework assignments and programming projects with your classmates, the
course staff, and with me. 
However, you should write up your own written homework solutions
and should not read or copy the solutions written by others (in
this or previous terms, at Dartmouth or elsewhere). 
<p>
You should also write your own code and
not read code written by classmates.
<p>

The Dartmouth College policy on sources also applies to
this course, which means that all sources must be acknowledged,
whether allowed by the instructor or not.  For example, software
given to you by us must be acknowledged 
when incorporated into your work.<br>
<p>
(Whether you go into industry or academia or elsewhere,
it would be good to get in the habit of keeping track of and citing
all your sources anyway!)
<p>
<B>If you have any questions about the
honor code as it relates to CS 58, please come speak with me. 
Violations of the honor code will be treated seriously.</B>

<b>Students with Disabilities:</b>
</big><br>
<p>
I encourage students
with disabilities, including &quot;invisible&quot; disabilities
such as chronic diseases and learning disabilities, to discuss with
me any appropriate accommodations that I might make on their
behalf.
<p>
(If this may apply to you, I also urge you to discuss things with the
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~accessibility/"><b>Student Accessibility Services</b></a> office,  
if you haven't already.  They've set up a system where
they keep the "appropriate accommodations" on file---so you don't have
to discuss details with each new instructor!)
