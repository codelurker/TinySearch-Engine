We describe a set of natural image statistics that are built upon two 
multi-scale image decompositions, the quadrature mirror filter pyramid 
decomposition and the local angular harmonic decomposition.  These 
image statistics consist of first- and higher-order statistics that 
capture certain statistical regularities of natural images.  We propose 
to apply these image statistics, together with classification 
techniques, to three problems in digital image forensics: (1) 
differentiating photographic images from computer-generated 
photorealistic images, (2) generic steganalysis; (3) rebroadcast image 
detection. We also apply these image statistics to the traditional art 
authentication for forgery detection and identification of artists in 
an art work.  For each application we show the effectiveness of these 
image statistics and analyze their sensitivity and robustness.
