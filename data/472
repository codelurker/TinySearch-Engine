  <p> <b>Baking:</b> These days I am trying my hand at baking; I have spruced up my bakeware a bit and have tried baking a couple of breads from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vegetarian-Classics-Essential-Recipes-Every/dp/0060932732/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1238446809&sr=1-1">Jeanne Lemlin's book</a>. Big thank you to Surabhi didi for gifting us this book. It is a treasure-house of so many different types of yummy recipes; if it weren't for this book, I would probably never have given pasta a second chance.

  <p> <b>Gardening:</b> In summer 2008, we used the small patch outside our home to grow a few vegetables and flowers. We grew Roma tomatoes, capsicum, cilantro, basil, mint, and baby spinach. In flowers, we grew Gladioli, Dahlias, and Primrose. We were so satisfied (and proud) with the outcome that we are even more enthusiastic about growing stuff this year.

  <p> Last but definitely not the least, I love dogs! Some day I hope to own one (after I manage to convince Paritosh enough :-)) and a Golden Retriever tops my choice of breeds, followed by German Shepherd and Labrador.
