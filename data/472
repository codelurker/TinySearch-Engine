<b>Abstract:</b>
Anonymizing networks such as Tor allow users to access Internet
services privately by using a series of routers to hide the client's
IP address from the server.  The success of such networks, however,
has been limited by users employing this anonymity for abusive
purposes such as defacing popular websites.  Website administrators
routinely rely on IP-address blocking for disabling access to
misbehaving users, but blocking IP addresses is not practical if the
abuser routes through an anonymizing network.  As a result,
administrators block \emph{all} known exit nodes of anonymizing
networks, denying anonymous access to misbehaving and behaving users
alike.  To address this problem, we present Nymble, a system in which
servers can ``blacklist'' misbehaving users, thereby \emph{blocking
users without compromising their anonymity}. Our system is thus
agnostic to different servers' definitions of misbehavior --- servers
can blacklist users for whatever reason, and the privacy of
blacklisted users is maintained.

<b>Note:</b>
Nymble first appeared in a PET '07 paper. This paper presents a
significantly improved construction and a complete rewrite and
evaluation of our (open-source) implementation.
