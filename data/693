are several great books out there covering some of the material, none
comprehensively introduces the topics we'll cover (biomolecular
sequence, structure, and function) from a computational perspective.
Thus I'll distribute lecture notes and provide references to the
research literature.</td></tr>

<td valign="top"><b>Overview</b></td>
<td><p>Computation is vital for modern molecular biology, helping
scientists to model, predict the behaviors of, and control the
molecular machinery of the cell.  This course will study algorithmic
challenges in analyzing biomolecular <i>sequences</i> (what genes
encode an organism, and how are genes related across organisms?),
<i>structures</i> (what do the proteins constructed for these genes
look like, and what does that tell us about their mechanisms?), and
<i>functions</i> (what do these things do, and how do they interact
with each other in doing it?).  The course is application-driven, but
focused on the underlying algorithms and information processing
techniques, employing approaches from search, optimization, pattern
recognition, and so forth.</p>

<p>Here's a fun little <a href="flyer.pdf">flyer</a> for CS types.</p>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Expected background</b></td>
<td><p>This is an introductory course targeted at advanced undergraduate and
beginning graduate students in computer science.  A background in
biology is not required, but students should be interested in catching
up quickly on some basic molecular biology and biochemistry.  Bruce
Donald's <a
href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~brd/Teaching/Bio/current/">Topics
in Computational Molecular Biology</a> is a natural successor for
those who would like additional depth in the applications and
algorithms.</p>

<p>While the course is structured from an algorithmic perspective, I very
much welcome and encourage the participation of students from the life
sciences, statistics, and other related disciplines.  Naturally, a
basic understanding of and interest in computational issues is
expected.  Please contact me to discuss your background and interests.</p>

<td>
<p>The course seeks to provide broad exposure to some important
algorithmic challenges and approaches in bioinformatics.  The lectures
and readings will provide a fairly general (for a ten-week course)
survey of the field.  Since one of the best ways to learn something is
by doing it, a series of labs will offer the opportunity to implement
and apply some of the algorithms.  Each lab will be introduced in
conjunction with the relevant lecture, and a portion of the class time
will be devoted to getting started on the lab.  After each pair of
labs on related topics (sequence, structure, and function), a class
will be devoted to student presentations and discussion about the
labs.</p>

<p>All students are expect to read, understand, and follow the
<a href="policies.html">course policies</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="schedule.html">course schedule</a> lists due dates,
topics, and readings.</p>
