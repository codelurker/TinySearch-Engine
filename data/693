<h3>Announcements</h3> 
<p>
<h4>What's New <img src = "images/new.gif" alight = left> </h4>
<ul>
<li>(03/18/09) Final project grades are now online.  The projects were graded based on the quality of the proposal, update, and final report.  I also took into consideration the code, results, and quality of the analysis in the report.
</ul>

<h4>What's Old  <img src = "images/old.gif" alight = left> </h4>
<ul>
<li>(03/06/09) Final project reports are due Friday.
<li> (02/28/09) Lu's office hours will be on Sunday 5:00pm-6:00pm (Mar.1) this weekend and Thursday 4:00pm-6:00pm (Mar.5) this coming week in Sudikoff 110. 
<li> (02/25/09) On Friday, we will have a guest lecture by 
<a href = "http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~lorenzo/">Prof. Lorenzo Torresani</a> on <em>machine learning</em>.  
<li> (02/20/09) The class is canceled for Monday, February 23, for you to work on your project proposals.  Please turn in your Assignment Three to Lu in her office in Sudikoff 220 at 1:45 PM, as usual.  
<li> (02/20/09) The
<a href = "project.html">Project</a>
page is now live and linked in.
It contains last year's project proposals, updates, and final reports.
<li> (02/20/09) Daniel points out that the subset predicate in SWI-Prolog may not be used with findall.  Depending on how you define subset, you may have a simialr problem.  Try focusing on why your subset does not <em>generate</em> subsets.  If you understand it better, you may redefine it to use it with findall.
<li> (02/20/09) In case you were not in class today:
<ul>
<li> I passed out Midterm solutions.  There are additional copies in the  
     CS 44 Box, right outside of Sudikoff 115.  Please make sure you 
     review the solutions, and in particular, follow the format of the
     resolution proof in your Assignment Three.
<li> I also gave out Final Project Instructions, which are available, as usual, online on the 
<a href="handouts/schedule.html">Schedule</a>
and 
<a href="handouts/schedule.html">Resources</a>
pages.
</ul>

<em>
  Toward High-level Reasoning for Autonomous Systems</em>.
The colloquium is on Wednesday in Moore Filene Auditorium at 4:30 PM, 
following the Weekly Tea at 4 PM.
<li> (02/02/09) Please send Lu a password for viewing grades online.
<li> (01/30/09) Nimit correctly points out that there is an error in the first line of Section 2.3:  legal_moves is not a boolean function.  Also, the move should specify whether player X or O is playing (both for do-move and undo-move.)
<li> (01/28/09) Today's

<li> (01/19/09) Karn correctly pointed out that DFS gets into an infinite loop with the graph in the homework.  This is fine:  after reaching the loop, stop and point out that the algorithm does not terminate successfully.  This is, after all, one reason why DFS is not optimal.
<li> (01/14/09) Today's
