You <b>may not</b> discuss these problems with anyone except
Prof. Drysdale.  You are to work alone.  You <b>may not</b> 
use any materials other
than class notes and the two textbooks to solve them.

<ol>
<li> CLRS 35-1 (p. 1049) <br> <br>
<li> MR Problem 1.8 (a) (p. 26).   <br> <br>
<li> MR Exercise 8.7 (p. 230)  Give an exact expression for the
     expected length of the path between an element <i>x</i> whose rank
     is <i>k</i> and an element <i>y</i> whose rank is <i>k+r</i>. <br> <br>

<li> Consider a collection of <i>m</i> sets <i>S<sub>j</sub></i> drawn 
     from some universe 
     <i>U</i>.  The goal is to try to find the smallest set <i>Z</i> 
     whose intersection 
     with every set <i>S<sub>j</sub></i> is non-empty.  (<i>Z</i> is called a 
     hitting set - it hits every one of the <i>S<sub>j</sub></i>.) <br> <br>

     <ol>
     <li> Create an integer program whose solution solves this 
          problem.  Explain why it solves the problem. <br> <br>
     
     <li> Show how to relax the integer program to create a linear 
          program.  Suppose that the objective function to this 
          linear program has an optimal solution <i>w</i>.  Show how to 
          use randomized rounding to get a set
          <i>Z</i> of expected size <i>w</i> which is expected to intersect
          at least a fixed fraction of the sets <i>S<sub>j</sub></i>.  
          Give a specific lower
          bound on the expected fraction of sets intersected. <br> <br>

     <li> Give a good bound on the probability that the size of 
          the set <i>Z</i> found is
          larger than <i>cw</i>, for any constant <i>c</i> &gt 1.  
          For which values of 
          <i>c</i> is the probability given by your bound no larger than 
          <i>e<sup>-w</sup></i>?
           <br> <br>
     </ol>

<li> The Aethernet corporation has developed a protocol to allow
     <i>n</i> machines to communicate on a shared wire.  Time is divided
     into fixed slots.  In a slot, any machine that wants to send
     information to another can broadcast it onto the wire.  If
     exactly one machine broadcasts in a given time slot, then 
     that broadcast is successful.  If more than one machine 
     broadcasts, then the broadcast fails.  <p>Their protocol is
     simple - whenever a machine wants to broadcast, with probability
     1/<i>n</i> it broadcasts in the current slot.  It succeeds if nobody
     else tries to broadcast in that slot.  If it chooses not to
     broadcast or tries and fails it repeats the process in the next 
     time slot. <br> <br>

     <ol>
     <li> Show that even if all machines are trying to broadcast
          in a given slot, there is a constant probability that some 
          machine will succeed.  Give a good approximation of 
          this constant probability as n grows large. <br> <br>

     <li> Assume that the machines are all trying to send infinite
          sequences of packets, so that each wants to send a packet
          in every time slot.  What is the expected time until every
          machine has sent at least one packet? <br> <br>

     <li> Again assume that the machines are all trying to send infinite
          sequences of packets, so that each wants to send a packet
          in every time slot.  Show that over a sufficient length of 
          time (number of time slots), with high probability every 
          machine broadcasts at least some constant times 1/<i>n</i> of the
          times it wants to send a message 
          (thus achieving a fair share of the bandwidth). In other
          words, if there are <i>s</i> slots and M is one of the machines,
          then with high probability, M broadcasts in Omega(<i>s/n</i>) slots.
