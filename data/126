<H1>Theory and Algorithms </H1>

The theory of computing is the study of efficient computation, 
models of computational processes, and their limits. 
It has emerged over the past few decades as a deep and fundamental 
scientific discipline.  Many fundamental questions are still
unanswered.
This field has potential to substantially impact
current issues in the development of systems and software, the 
nation's network and communications infrastructure, and the 
physical and biological sciences.

<p>
Our faculty and students are actively involved in areas 
such as the design of fundamental algorithms, 
combinatorial optimization, 
distributed and parallel computation,
machine learning, computational complexity theory, 
computational geometry and topology, 
dynamical systems, multimedia and image processing, compression,
and the computational sciences.

<h2> Reading Group </h2> Dartmouth has an active theory reading group.
We have vigorous, exciting discussions/presentations on recent
research in theoretical computer science (TCS).  Everyone is welcome;
consult the <a href="winter_2009.html">TRG web page</a> for more details.

<b> 
<a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~ac">
Amit Chakrabarti</a>
</b>
works on complexity theory, with an emphasis on proving
lower bounds in concrete computational models, and to a lesser extent on
approximation algorithms and space-efficient streaming algorithms. He is
a co-inventor of the "information complexity" paradigm. He received an
NSF Career Award in 2005.
<p>
<b> 
<a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc">
Tom Cormen</a>
</b>
works on algorithm engineering and parallel computing.  He
focuses on algorithms and software infrastructure to mitigate the high
latency inherent in accessing the outer levels of the memory hierarchy and
in interprocessor communication.  He is coauthor of the leading textbook on
computer algorithms, <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i>.
<p>
<b> 
<a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~scot">
Scot Drysdale</a>
</b>
works in computational geometry.  Much of his work has been
on Voronoi diagrams for various shapes and distance measures, on Delaunay
triangulations, and on applications of these structures.  He has also worked
on problems arising from numerically controlled machining.
<p>
<b> 
<a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~lkf">
Lisa Fleischer</a>
</b>
works on algorithm design and analysis for problems in
 network routing and design, combinatorial optimization, 
and linear programming.  Her recent work focusses in the area
of algorithmic economics and game theory.  She received
the Fulkerson Prize in 2003, an NSF Career Award in 2000.
<p>
<b> 
<a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~prasad">
Prasad Jayanti</a>
</b>
works on concurrent/distributed algorithms and lower bounds, especially for
problems relating to synchronization and fault tolerance in asynchronous
systems.  His recent work includes snapshot algorithms, abortable locks, and
priority locks.  He received the Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship in 2000.
<p>
<b> 
<a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~rockmore">
Dan Rockmore</a>
</b>
works mainly in applied and computational harmonic
analysis, primarily related to generalizations of the fast Fourier
transform. He has worked in signal and image processing and
computational biology. He is also Chairman of the Department of
Mathematics and on the external faculty of the Santa Fe Institute
where he is Director of the Complex Systems Summer School.
<p>
<b> 
<a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~pw">
Peter Winkler</a>
</b>
devises and studies algorithms, for example those which
rely on rapidly mixing Markov chains.  His methods usually involve
combinatorics, probability or statistical physics. Formerly Director of
Fundamental Mathematics Research at Bell Labs, he is now Albert
Bradley Third Century Professor in the Sciences at Dartmouth, and
is on the faculties of both computer science and mathematics.
<p>
<b> 
<a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~afra">
Afra Zomorodian</a>
</b>
works in computational topology.  He is known for his work on the
theory of persistent homology and its applications.
