<META NAME="abstract" CONTENT="This thesis proposes algorithms for implementing a atomic multi-word buffer,
which can be accessed concurrently by multiple readers and a single writer, 
from the hardware-supported shared memory. The algorithms are required to be 
wait-free: each process reads or writes the multi-word buffer in a bounded 
number of its own steps, regardless of whether other processes are fast, slow 
or have crashed.
	Our first algorithm is built from multi-writer, multi-reader variables 
whereas the second algorithm is built from single-writer, multi-reader 
variables. For either algorithm, the worst-case running time of a read or a 
write operation on the m-word buffer is O(m). The space complexity of the 
algorithms is O(mn). Neither algorithm requires hardware support for any 
special synchronization instructions; the ability to read or write into any 
machine word is sufficient. The algorithms significantly improve on Peterson's 
algorithm, which has O(mn) time complexity for the write operation on the 
buffer. ">

<b>Abstract:</b>
This thesis proposes algorithms for implementing a atomic multi-word buffer,
which can be accessed concurrently by multiple readers and a single writer, 
from the hardware-supported shared memory. The algorithms are required to be 
wait-free: each process reads or writes the multi-word buffer in a bounded 
number of its own steps, regardless of whether other processes are fast, slow 
or have crashed.
</P><P>
	Our first algorithm is built from multi-writer, multi-reader variables 
whereas the second algorithm is built from single-writer, multi-reader 
variables. For either algorithm, the worst-case running time of a read or a 
write operation on the m-word buffer is O(m). The space complexity of the 
algorithms is O(mn). Neither algorithm requires hardware support for any 
special synchronization instructions; the ability to read or write into any 
machine word is sufficient. The algorithms significantly improve on Peterson's 
algorithm, which has O(mn) time complexity for the write operation on the 
buffer.
