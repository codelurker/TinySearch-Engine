<h4>Homework</h4>

<p> Homework assignments will be given out roughly once a week. There
will be a homework given out each Wednesday and it will be due at the
<i>beginning</i> of next Wednesday's class (with perhaps one exception,
for Homework 5).  Homework is to be submitted <i>before</i> you come
into class, into the box(es) marked "CS 39 IN" right outside the lecture
hall. </p>

A few important notes on the homework assignments:

<ul>

  <li><strong>Start early:</strong>  Some problems will be hard and are
  not typically solved in one sitting.  Start early and let the ideas come
  to you over the course of a few days.</li>

  <li><strong>Be rigorous:</strong> CS 39 is a theory course, and so
  mathematical rigor will be expected in your solutions.</li>

  <li><strong>Be concise:</strong>  Express your solution at the proper
  level of detail.  Long, verbose answers are strongly discouraged.  Give
  enough details to clearly present your solution, but not so many that
  the main ideas are obscured.  </li>

  <li><strong>You can discuss with others:</strong>  Some of the
  problems will be difficult, and it will often be helpful to discuss them
  with others.  Feel free to form study groups.  However, the idea is for
  everyone to understand the problems and experience working through the
  solutions, so you <em>may not</em> simply "give" a solution to another
  classmate.  In particular, each student <em>must</em> write up his or
  her own homework solutions and <em>must not</em> read or copy the
  solutions of others.  If you work with others on a problem,  you
  <em>must</em> note with whom you discussed the problem at the beginning
  of your solution write-up. </li>

  <li><strong>Work on your own before talking to others:</strong>
  Although, as I said above, you can discuss the homework problems with
  others, you will learn the most by first trying out each problem on your
  own.  Make as much progress as possible on your own before you meet with
  your study group. </li>

</ul>

<h4>Late Submission Policy</h4>

<p> Any homework submitted late carries an <i>immediate 20% penalty</i>
(unless you have a very good excuse and have discussed it with me in
advance), and an additional 10% penalty per calendar day after that. No
homework will be accepted after the next homework is due, or after the
final.  In this course, if you do not do homework on time, you will soon
find yourself overwhelmed, so please be regular with your work. </p>

<p> For any late submission, it is the <em>student's
resposnsibility</em> to ensure that the grader receives the homework.
Please do not just put your late submission in the usual homework
submission box. Make sure you personally see the grader receiving your
late submission and timestamping it. </p>

<p> The late submission policy for the finals is simple, and drastic.
<strong>A final exam submitted after the deadline will be returned 
ungraded and will earn zero credit</strong>. So please don't do that! </p>

<h4>Challenge Problems</h4>

Occasionally, the homeworks will contain one or two "challenge
problems". They are to be thought of as "extra credit" work and will be
tallied separately from regular score. If you end up on a borderline
between two grades at the end of the course or are being considered for
a citation, this extra credit will count in your favor.  However, failure to
solve challenge problems will never be counted against you because grades are
assigned on the basis of regular scores. </p>

<p> You should work on these challenge problems if you find them
interesting and you think that they might teach you something.  It is
unwise to skimp on regular homework problems in order to attack these
challenge problems, though. </p>

<a name=honorcode></a>
<h4> Working Together and the Honor Principle </h4>

<p> Students are encouraged to work together to do homework problems.
Groups who work well together in class should consider working together
to do homework. What is important is a student's eventual understanding
of homework problems, and not how that is achieved. </p>

<p> The honor principle applies to homework
in the following way. What a student turns is as a homework solution
is to be <i>his or her own understanding</i> of how to do the problem. In
preparing the draft of the homework to be turned in, a student <b>may not
consult the notes or homework solutions of another student or any
solutions to homework problems in past offerings of the course posted
on the web.</b> Students <i>may</i> consult any source (including those just
forbidden for the final draft), <b>except for another student's final
draft</b>, in <i>learning</i> how to do homework problems.
<b>Students must state
what sources they have consulted, with whom they have collaborated,
and from whom they have received help.</b> However students are
discouraged from using solutions to problems posted on the web for
previous offerings of the course, and as just stated, must reference
them if they use them. </p>

<p> The honor principle applies to exams as follows. <b>Students may
not give or receive assistance of any kind on an exam from any
person, including the professor</b>. </p>

<h4> Students with Disabilities </h4>

Students with disabilities enrolled in this course and who may need
disability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to make an
appointment with the professor to discuss the matter, by Jan 16, 2009.
All discussions will remain confidential, although the Student
Accessibility Services office may be consulted to discuss appropriate
implementation of any accommodation requested.
