  <li><b>Title:&nbsp;</b>Touchy Feely Games: Broadening Designers' Social and Emotional Palette</li>
  <li> <b>Abstract:&nbsp; </b> In the 1980s the fledgling Electronic Arts company asked 'Can a  Computer Make You Cry?' in a famous advertising campaign, and set a  challenge for the field that many would say has yet to be fully  realized. The popular press often emphasizes violent or 'primitive'  emotions in its portrayal of games, and holds up the solitary  antisocial gamer as a warning to us all. Yet the Entertainment Software  Association reports that over half of gaming is done socially, and game  designers and developers have recently renewed enthusiasm and efforts  devoted to making games more emotionally rich and appealing. I believe  that a wide range of social and emotional qualities can be designed  into games and other interactive experiences, and will present research  projects that show my efforts to understand what drives emotion and  social connection, and that apply what I've learned to create designed  experiences that push the boundaries of the medium toward a broader  social and emotional palette.</li>
  <li> <b>Bio: </b> Katherine Isbister is an Associate Professor of Digital Media and  Computer Science and Engineering at NYU-Poly, and also maintains an  affiliation at the ITU Copenhagen Center for Computer Games Research.  She received her Ph.D. from Stanford University, with a focus on  applying human social behavior to the design of digital characters.  Since then, she has worked in both industry and research venues to  create and evaluate interfaces that enhance the player (or user)  experience using social and emotional qualities.  <br />
    <br />
    Dr. Isbister has written two books: Better Game Characters by  Design: A Psychological Approach, and Game Usability: Advice from the  Experts for Advancing the Player Experience. Better Game Characters was  nominated for a Game Developer Magazine Frontline Award in 2006. <br />
    <br />
    Current research interests include emotion and gesture in games,  supple interactions, design of game characters, and game usability. Dr.  Isbister presents and publishes her work in Human Computer Interaction  (HCI) and Game Studies venues. She has received funding from both  governmental and private sources, including the U.S. National Science  Foundation and companies such as Electronic Arts.&nbsp; She serves on the  advisory board of the International Game Developers Association Games  Education Special Interest Group, and on the Editorial Board of the  International Journal of Human Computer Studies. In 1999 Katherine  Isbister was selected as one of MIT Technology Review's TR100 Young  Innovators most likey to shape the future of technology. <br />

  <li><b>Title:&nbsp;</b>Honest Signals</li>
  <li> <b>Abstract: </b>We are in the midst of an explosion of information about people and  their behavior, but most of it is noise.  Reality Mining sifts through  this noise to discover the `honest signals' hidden within: subtle  patterns that reliably reveal our relationships with other people, and  accurately predict our future behavior. Honest signals offer an  unmatched window into our financial, cultural, and organizational  health. By understanding these subtle patterns we can better understand  ourselves, and begin to create true collective intelligences.&nbsp; </li>

  <li><b>Title:&nbsp;</b>Simultaneous Graph Embedding</li>
  <li> <b>Abstract:&nbsp; </b> Traditional problems in graph visualization deal with a single graph  while simultaneous graph visualization involves multiple related  graphs. In the latter case nodes are placed in the same locations in  all graphs and the graphs are simultaneously embeddable if  crossing-free drawings for each graph can be found. We present  polynomial time algorithms for simultaneous embedding of several  classes of planar graphs and prove that some classes of graphs cannot  be simultaneously embedded. More interesting are the half dozen  variations: simultaneous geometric embedding, with and without mapping,  colored simultaneous embeddings, near simultaneous embeddings, and  matched embeddings. </li>
  <li> <b>Bio: </b>Stephen Kobourov's research interests include information  visualization, graph drawing and geometric algorithms, emphasizing  problems relating to graph visualization. He received a BS in Computer  Science and Mathematics from Dartmouth College in 1995 and PhD in  Computer Science from Johns Hopkins University in 2000. He worked at  the University of Arizona where he received a NSF Career grant and was  tenured in 2006. As a Fulbright Scholar he spent a sabbatical year at  the University of Botswana.

  <li><b>Title:&nbsp;</b>Delaunay Mesh Generation for Piecewise Smooth Domains</li>
  <li> <b>Abstract:&nbsp; </b> Automatic mesh generation of various domains  is an important goal in CAD. Recent sampling theory coupled with the Delaunay refinement strategy have proven to be effective for this problem. However, piecewise smooth surfaces and volumes remained as a challenge. Specifically, small angles subtended at non-smooth regions pose a serious obstacle to the strategy. In this talk we describe a method that removes the obstacle and can generate Delaunay meshes of piecewise smooth surfaces, volumes, and non-manifolds. The method is practical and has been implemented into a software called DelPSC which is available from <a href="http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/%7Etamaldey/delpsc.html">http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~tamaldey/delpsc.html</a>. </li>
  <li> <b>Bio: </b> Tamal K. Dey is professor of computer science  at The Ohio State University. His research interest includes computational geometry, computational topology and their applications in graphics and geometric modeling. After finishing his PhD from Purdue University in 1991 he spent a year in University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign as a post doctoral fellow. He has held academic positions in Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis, IndianInstitute of Technology, Kharagpur, India, and Max-Planck Institute, Germany. Recently he authored a book ``Curve and surface reconstruction: Algorithms with mathematical analysis&quot; published by Cambridge University Press.

  <li><b>Title:&nbsp;</b>Sparse Recovery Using Sparse Random Matrices</li>
  <li> <b>Abstract:&nbsp;</b>Over the recent years, a new *linear* method for compressing high-dimensional data (e.g., images) has been discovered. For any high-dimensional vector x, its *sketch* is equal to Ax, where A is an m x n matrix (possibly chosen at random). Although typically the sketch length m is much smaller than the number of dimensions n, the sketch contains enough information to recover an *approximation* to x. At the same time, the linearity of the sketching method is very convenient for many applications, such as data stream computing and compressed sensing. <br />
    The major sketching approaches can be classified as either combinatorial (using sparse sketching matrices) or geometric (using dense sketching matrices). They achieve different trade-offs, notably between the compression rate and the running time. Thus, it is desirable to understand the connections between them, with the goal of obtaining the &quot;best of both worlds&quot; solution. <br />
    In this talk we show that, in a sense, the combinatorial and geometric approaches are based on different manifestations of the same phenomenon. This connection will enable us to obtain several novel algorithms and constructions, which inherit advantages of sparse matrices, such as lower sketching and recovery times. <br />

  <li><b>Title:&nbsp;</b>Graph approximation and local clustering, with applications to the solution of diagonally-dominant systems of linear equations</li>
  <li> <b>Abstract:&nbsp;</b>We discuss several fascinating concepts and algorithms in graph theory that arose in the design of a nearly-linear time algorithm for solving diagonally-dominant linear systems.  We begin by defining a new notion of what it means to approximate a graph by another graph, and explain why these sparse approximations enable the fast solution of linear equations.  To build these sparsifiers, we rely on low-stretch spanning trees, random matrix theory, spectral graph theory, and graph partitioning algorithms. <br/>
    The need to quickly partition a graph leads us to the local clustering problem: given a vertex in a massive graph,  output a small cluster near that vertex in time proportional to the size of the cluster.<br/>
    We use all these tools to design nearly-linear time algorithms for solving diagonally-dominant systems of linear equations, and give some applications. <br />

  <li><b>Title:&nbsp; </b>Investigations at the Interface of Morphology, Evolution and Cognition </li>
  <li> <b>Abstract:&nbsp; </b> Most computational attempts to understand cognition have focused on its  proximate mechanisms: understanding the function of existing biological  systems related to cognition and implementing them in artificial  systems. In this talk I will discuss several robotics projects I have  been involved in in which we try to shed light on the ultimate  mechanisms of cognition: what selection pressures and task environments  lead to the appearance of particular cognitive abilities, and what  morphological and neural structures must evolve to support those  abilities. </li>

  <li><b>Title:&nbsp;</b>Euler Calculus for Sensor Networks</li>
  <li> <b>Abstract:&nbsp; </b> This work is motivated by a fundamental problem in  sensor networks -- the need to aggregate redundant sensor data across a network. We focus on simple problems of enumerating and localizing targets using a network of minimal sensors that can detect and count nearby targets, but cannot identify or localize them. We solve this problem with calculus --- but not the calculus of Netwon et al. An integration theory built from algebraic topology and the Euler characteristic provides a computable, robust, and powerful tool for data aggregation. </li>

  <li><b>Title:&nbsp;</b>Economics in Internet Design</li>
  <li> <b>Abstract:&nbsp; </b> As the Internet has developed to become the single most   important arena for resource sharing among parties with diverse and   selfish interests, traditional algorithmic and distributed systems   approaches are insufficient. To prevent undesirable Internet phenomena   such as spam in email systems, bid-sniping in eBay's auction   marketplace, free-loading in file-sharing networks, and click-fraud in   Internet advertising; game-theoretic and economic considerations from   auction theory must be applied. The first part of the talk is an   overview of the foundational 2007 Economics Nobel prize winning theory   of auction design. Unfortunately, this theory is insufficient for design   of Internet algorithms both for its reliance on (micro) payments   (whereas Internet protocols do not use payments) and because it suggests   a different auction for every setting (whereas an Internet protocol must   work well under a wide range of workloads). The second part of the talk   develops an economic theory appropriate for Internet design. </li>
  <li> <b>Bio: </b> Dr. Hartline joined the EECS department at Northwestern University   in January of 2008.

  <li><b>Title:&nbsp;</b>Intelligent Assistive Technology:&nbsp; The Present and the  Future</li>
  <li> <b>Abstract:&nbsp;</b>Recent advances in two areas of computer  science&mdash;wireless sensor networks and AI inference strategies&mdash;have  made it possible to envision, and to begin developing, &nbsp;a wide range of  technologies that can improve the lives of people with physical, cognitive,  and/or psycho-social impairments.&nbsp; This talk will focus on assistive  technology for people with cognitive impairment, surveying the state-of-the-art  and speculating about future design challenges and opportunities. &nbsp;&nbsp;A  key theme will be that the usefulness and effectiveness of these systems  depends on their being adaptive to the often highly individualized and changing  needs of their users, and that to achieve these properties, designers must  integrate a variety of strategies for automated reasoning and  learning.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b> </b> </li>

  <li><b>Title:&nbsp;</b>Characterizing local neural representation as a multidimensional similarity space</li>
  <li> <b>Abstract:&nbsp; </b> Whereas  conventional univariate analysis of functional brain imaging data  characterized the function of a region in terms of the conditions that  activate that region, multivariate pattern (MVP) analysis characterizes  local function in terms of the conditions that evoke distinct patterns  of activity.&nbsp; Moreover, the dissimilarities of the patterns of activity  for different conditions can be quantified.&nbsp; Thus, local neural  representation can be analyzed in terms of a high-dimensional  similarity structure rather than as a (short) list of functions.&nbsp;  Functional differences among brain regions can similarly by analyzed as  differences in the neural representational space rather than as  different functional labels.&nbsp; For example, different categories of  visual stimuli &ndash; faces and objects &ndash; activate and evoke distinct  patterns of activity in medial occipital, inferior lateral occipital  (LO), and ventral temporal (VT) cortex, including when analysis is  restricted to subregions that respond maximally to faces (FFA) and  places (PPA).&nbsp; The similarity structure of the responses to categories,  however, differs significantly among these brain regions.&nbsp; Whereas LO  demonstrates larger distinctions than does VT within animate (faces of  different species) and inanimate domains (houses, chairs, and shoes),  VT demonstrates larger distinctions between the animate and inanimate  domains.&nbsp; Medial occipital cortex, on the other hand, demonstrates a  similarity structure that is not dominated by the animate-inanimate  distinction at all.&nbsp; MVP analysis, therefore, reveals how local neural  representation projects information into different subspaces that  emphasize different distinctions among conditions.&nbsp; These methods  provide a powerful tool for investigating how information is processed  and re-represented in hierarchical and distributed neural systems.</li>

  <li><b>Title:&nbsp;</b> The Problem with Music: Modeling Distance Distributions of  Large Music Collections</li>
  <li> <b>Abstract: </b>Recently, a number of piano recordings by different artists were found in a classical music catalog that exhibited a striking resemblance to each other. Could this resemblance be purely coincidental? We set about building a system that could answer this question and others in large recorded collections of music. The AudioDB system listens to polyphonic music recordings and encodes important perceptual information about them at fine time scales. The information extracted corresponds to traditional music-theoretic concepts such as, harmony, timbre, pitch, texture and rhythm yielding a high-dimensional representation; consisting of 300-1200 dimensions.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our music databases have 10<sup>4<sup></sup></sup>-10<sup>7<sup></sup></sup> recordings, each with thousands of vectors, so brute-force methods for similarity computation are not practical. Instead, we use locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) which searches in high dimensions with sub-linear time complexity. We propose a method for automatically estimating the radius threshold for efficient and accurate LSH retrieval. Our method employs statistical sampling of the background distance distribution and solving for the minimum distance distribution using order statistics.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using these methods, we are able to quantify the &quot;purely coincidental&quot; resemblance in the piano recordings mentioned above, demonstrating that their similarity is not, in fact, coincidental. The newer recordings are altered copies of the older ones. Detecting fraudulent recordings with human hearing is difficult; even the music critics were fooled into highly commending these newer recordings. We conclude that scalable audio search systems, such as AudioDB, are required to address the emerging multimedia needs of the Internet, commercial music services and large multimedia archives.<br />

  <li><b>Title:&nbsp;</b>Invariant Representations of Visual Streams in the Spike Domain</li>
  <li> <b>Abstract:&nbsp; </b> We investigate an architecture for invariant representations of visual  stimuli such as natural and synthetic video streams (movies, animation)  in the spike domain. The stimuli are encoded with a population of  spiking neurons, processed in the spike domain and finally decoded. The  population of spiking neurons includes level crossing as well as  integrate-and-fire neuron models with feedback. A number of spike  domain processing algorithms are demonstrated including faithful  stimulus recovery, as well as simple operations on the original  visual stimulus such as translations, rotations and zooming. All these  operations are executed in the spike domain. Finally, the processed  spike trains are decoded for the faithful recovery of the stimulus and its transformations.<br />
    We  show that the class of linear operations described above can easily be  realized with the same basic stimulus decoding algorithm. What changes  in the architecture, however, is the switching matrix (i.e., the  input/output ``wiring'') of the spike domain switching building block.  For example, for a particular setting of the switching matrix, the  original stimulus is faithfully recovered. For other settings,  translations, rotations and dilations (or combinations of these  operations) of the original video stream are obtained.</li>

  <li><b>Title:&nbsp;</b>Towards a Storage-centric Sensor Network Architecture</li>
  <li> <b>Abstract:&nbsp; </b> A significant amount of sensor network research has addressed the  problem of energy-efficiency, primarily by exploiting the fact that  local computation is considerably less expensive than wireless  communication. However, NAND flash memories allow storage to be more  than two orders of magnitude cheaper than communication, significantly  altering existing tradeoffs. In this talk, I will present our&nbsp; research  on the design of a &quot;rich sensor data management stack&quot; that aims to  make the role of storage central in sensor systems. I will focus on two  recent research efforts in this talk.&nbsp; First, I will describe the  design of novel flash-optimized index structures&nbsp;for archival storage  and querying of sensor data.&nbsp; Second, I will describe an embedded image  search engine to enable local storage of images on camera sensors (or  mobile phones), and fast and efficient distributed search across such a  camera network.</li>

  <li> <b>Abstract:&nbsp; </b> Over the last decade, the robotics community has developed highly efficient and  robust solutions to state estimation problems such as robot localization, people tracking, and map building.&nbsp; With the availability of various techniques for spatially consistent sensor integration, an important next goal is to enable robots to reason about the many objects located in our everyday environments and to reason about spatial concepts such as rooms, hallways, streets, and intersections.&nbsp; An additional requirement for successful operation in populated environments is the ability to recognize the intent of humans and to adapt to their behavior patterns. <br />
    In this talk I will present an overview of some recent work using graphical models and machine learning techniques to extract high level information from raw sensor data.&nbsp; Examples include place and object recognition from vision and laser data, and human activity recognition from wearable sensor data.&nbsp; I will conclude with an outlook for research directions in autonomous systems.</li>

  <li><b>Title:&nbsp;</b>A System for High-Volume Acquisition and Matching of Fresco Fragments: Reassembling Theran Wall Paintings </li>
  <li> <b>Abstract:&nbsp; </b>The archaeological site of Akrotiri on the volcanic island of Thera (modern-day Santorini, Greece) has yielded an unparalleled trove of artifacts and information from the prehistoric Aegean.&nbsp; The ancient civilization was destroyed by a volcanic eruption, which buried the remains of a flourishing Late Bronze Age (c. 1630 B.C.) settlement in ash. Among the most significant finds are numerous wall paintings, ranging from naturalistic and narrative scenes to abstract motifs.&nbsp; However, these paintings are recovered as thousands of plaster fragments, and reassembling them consumes a substantial portion of the effort expended at Akrotiri. <br />
    I will describe a system that uses 3-D and 2-D digitization hardware, together with computer-based matching techniques, to assist archaeologists and conservators in documenting and reassembling the wall paintings. Although mature technologies exist for acquiring images, geometry, and surface normals of small objects, they remain cumbersome and time-consuming for non-experts to employ on a large scale.&nbsp; Our system addresses the scalability, usability, and quality challenges of large-scale 3-D and 2-D digitization, by incorporating new algorithms to automatically align 3-D scans, register 2-D scans to 3-D geometry, and compute surface normals from 2-D scans.&nbsp; A novel 3-D matching algorithm efficiently searches for matching fragments using the scanned geometric models. </li>

  <li><b>Title:&nbsp;</b>Brains, Meaning and Corpus Statistics</li>
  <li> <b>Abstract:&nbsp; </b> How does the human brain represent meanings of words and pictures in terms of the underlying neural activity?  This talk will present our research using machine learning methods together with fMRI brain imaging to study this question.  One line of our research has involved training classifiers that identify which word a person is thinking about, based on the image of their fMRI brain activity.  A more recent line involves developing a generative computational model that predicts the neural activity associated with arbitrary English words, including words for which we do not yet have brain image data.  This computational model is trained using a combination of fMRI data associated with several dozen concrete nouns, together with statistics gathered from a trillion-word text corpus.  Once trained, the model predicts fMRI activation for any other concrete noun appearing in the tera-word text corpus, with highly significant accuracies over the 100 nouns for which we currently have fMRI data.</li>

  <li><b>Title:&nbsp;</b>I/O-Efficient Indexes for Fat Triangulations and Low-Density Planar Subdivisions </li>
  <li> <b>Abstract:&nbsp; </b> The traditional approach to algorithms design considers each atomic  operation to take roughly the same amount of time. Unfortunately this assumption is not valid&nbsp; when the algorithm operates on data stored on disk: reading data from or writing data to disk&nbsp; can be a factor 1,000,000 or more slower than an operation on data that is&nbsp; already present&nbsp; in main memory.&nbsp; This has led to the study of so-called I/O- <br />
    efficient algorithms, which specifically&nbsp; optimize&nbsp; the number of blocks transfered between main memory and disk. <br />
    <br />
    In this talk I will describe two I/O-efficient index structures for storing planar subdivisions.&nbsp; The structures are based on quadtrees and exploit features of realistic terrains:&nbsp; they are provably efficient when the input has&nbsp; low-density&nbsp; (any disk <em>D</em> is intersected by at most a constant number edges whose length is at least the diameter of <em>D</em>) or&nbsp; is a fat triangulation (every angle is bounded from below by a fixed constant), respectively. <br />
    <br />
    In particular, we show that a low-density subdivision with <em>n</em>&nbsp; edges can be preprocessed i in $O(\sort(n))$ IOs, allowing to compute the intersections between the edges of two such preprocessed subdivisions in $O(scan(n))$ IOs, where <em>n</em> is the total number of edges in the two subdivisions; and&nbsp; allowing to answer a single point location query in $O(\log_B n)$ IOs. <br />
    <br />
    The&nbsp; data structures improve on the previous best&nbsp; known bounds for overlaying subdivisions, both in the number of IOs and storage usage. Moreover, they are significantly simpler and they are cache- oblivious.&nbsp; preliminary experimental results have shown that they are fast and scalable in practice on real-world data. </li>

  <li><b>Title:&nbsp;</b>Model-Based Human Pose Tracking </li>
  <li><b>Abstract:&nbsp; </b> Future computer vision systems will recognize people and their activities,  enabling myriad new applications, such as smart mobile devices, advanced surveillance systems, and new perceptual man-machine interfaces. The detection, tracking and pose estimation of people from digital images are therefore key problems in Computer Vision.&nbsp; Pose estimation is especially challenging because image measurements are often insufficient to fully constrain 3D pose, and as a consequence, current formulations rely heavily on prior models of human pose and model. <br />
      <br />
    This talk presents two new techniques for modeling human pose and motion. The first is a probabilistic latent variable model called the Gaussian Process Dynamical Model.&nbsp; It is a form of probabilistic nonlinear dimensionality reduction for time-series data.&nbsp; The second class of models stems from Newtonian physics and biomechanical principles.&nbsp; The formulation of these models and applications to visual tracking will be described.

  <li><b>Title:&nbsp;</b>Brains, Meaning and Corpus Statistics</li>
  <li> <b>Abstract:&nbsp; </b> How does the human brain represent meanings of words and pictures in terms of the underlying neural activity?  This talk will present our research using machine learning methods together with fMRI brain imaging to study this question.  One line of our research has involved training classifiers that identify which word a person is thinking about, based on the image of their fMRI brain activity.  A more recent line involves developing a generative computational model that predicts the neural activity associated with arbitrary English words, including words for which we do not yet have brain image data.  This computational model is trained using a combination of fMRI data associated with several dozen concrete nouns, together with statistics gathered from a trillion-word text corpus.  Once trained, the model predicts fMRI activation for any other concrete noun appearing in the tera-word text corpus, with highly significant accuracies over the 100 nouns for which we currently have fMRI data.</li>

  <li><b>Title:&nbsp;</b>Human Computation</li>
  <li> <b>Abstract:&nbsp; </b> This talk is about harnessing human brainpower to solve problems that computers cannot. Although computers have advanced dramatically over the last 50 years, they still do not possess the basic conceptual intelligence or perceptual capabilities that most humans take for granted. By leveraging human abilities in a novel way, I want to solve large-scale computational problems and collect data to teach computers basic human talents. To this end, I treat human brains as processors in a distributed system, each performing a small part of a massive computation. Unlike computer processors, however, humans require an incentive to join a collective computation. Among other things, I show how to use online games as a means to encourage participation in the process.</li>
