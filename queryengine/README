The sources are arranged in the following directory:
lab6/shared/
	html.h html.c (HTML parsers, where getNextUrl() hides)
	
/lab6/data/   (where the data output from the crawler is stores)
	
lab6/queryengine/util (where the general purpose utilities file is located)
	input.c input.h (file access and input processing utilities are located)
	util.c util.h (misc. functions for dealing with lists among other things)

lab6/queryengine/src/
	query.c (the main entry, the indexer main logic is here)
	dictionary.h dictionary.c (contains index data structure library & related functions)
	queryengine_test.h (test script that query engine)
	logic.c logic.h (files for handling intersection, union of lists, etc.)
	hash.h hash.c (hash functions)
	data data.sort (temp data files for sorting)
	Makefile (make file for compiling the indexer)
	
	==> To build the queryengine
	goto /lab6/queryengine/src and type "make"

	==> To run the queryengine
	ex) "./query index.dat ../../data "

	==> To test the queryengine harness
	goto /lab6/indexer/src and type: make -f Makefile_normal
		-This function will test the various functions in query engine
